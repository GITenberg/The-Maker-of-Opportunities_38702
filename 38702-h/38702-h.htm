<h1>THE
MAKER OF OPPORTUNITIES</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p class="cap">It was two o&rsquo;clock. Mr. Mortimer Crabb
pushed back the chair from his breakfast
tray and languidly took up the
morning paper. He had a reputation (in
which he delighted) of dwelling in a Castle
of Indolence, and took particular pains that
no act of his should belie it. There were persons
who smiled at his affectations, for he had
a studio over a stable in one of the cross streets
up town, where he dawdled most of his days,
supine in his easy chair. The age was running
to athletics, so Mr. Crabb in public
had become the apostle and high priest of
flaccidity. He raised a supercilious eyebrow
at tennis, drawled his disparagement of polo
and racquets and recoiled at the mere<span class="ispan pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
mention of college football. But those
highest in Crabb&rsquo;s favor knew that there were
evenings when he met professional pugilists
at this same shrine of æstheticism, who, at
liberal compensation, matched their skill and
heft to his.</p>

<p>Nor was he a mean antagonist in conversation.
For Mr. Crabb had a slow and rather
halting way of making the most trenchantly
witty remarks, and a style exactly suited to
the successful dinner table. And when a
satiated society demanded something new it
was to Crabb they turned for a suggestion.
Mrs. Ryerson&rsquo;s Gainsborough ball, Jack Burrow&rsquo;s
remarkable ushers&rsquo; dinner, and the pet-dog
tea at Mrs. Jennings&rsquo; country place were
fantasies of the mind of this Prester John
of the effete. When to these remarkable talents
is added a yacht and a hundred and fifty
thousand a year, it is readily to be seen that
Mr. Mortimer Crabb was a person of consequence,
even in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. Crabb scanned the headlines of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
<i>Sun</i>, while McFee fastened his boots. But
his eye fell upon an item that made him sit
up straight and drop his monocle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&mdash;m!&rdquo; he muttered in a strange tone.
&ldquo;So Dicky Bowles is coming home!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He peered at the item again and read,
frowning.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Owing to the necessity for the immediate
departure of the prospective groom for Europe,
the marriage of Miss Juliet Hazard,
daughter of Mr. Henry Hazard, to Mr.
Carl Geltman will take place on Wednesday,
June twentieth, instead of in October,
the month at first selected.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Crabb&rsquo;s expression had suddenly undergone
a startling change, unknown in the Platonic
purlieus of the Bachelors&rsquo; Club. The brows
tangled, the lower jaw protruded, while the
feet which had languidly emerged from the
dressing-room a few moments before, had partaken
suddenly of the impulses which dominated
the entire body. He rose abruptly and
took a few rapid turns up and down the room.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So! They didn&rsquo;t dare wait! Poor little
Julie! There ought to be better things in
store for her than that! And Dicky won&rsquo;t be
here until Thursday morning! It&rsquo;s too evident&mdash;the
haste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dropped into his chair, picked up the
paper again, and re-read the item. June
twentieth! And to-day was Sunday, June
seventeenth! Geltman had taken no more
chances than decency demanded. Crabb
remembered the calamitous result of Hazard&rsquo;s
ventures in Wall Street, and it was common
gossip that, had it not been for Carl
Geltman, the firm of Hazard and Company
would long since have ceased to exist. It was
easy to read between the lines of the newspaper
paragraph. Between the ruin of her
father&rsquo;s fortunes and her own, duty left Juliet
Hazard no choice. And here was Dicky
Bowles upon the ocean coming back to claim
his own. It was monstrous.</p>

<p>Mr. Crabb laid aside the paper and paced
the floor again. Then walked to the window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and presently found himself smiling down
upon the hansom tops.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The very
thing. It&rsquo;s worth trying at any rate. Jepson
will help. And what a lark!&rdquo; And then
aloud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;McFee,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;get me a hansom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Carl Geltman sat in his office of
chamfered oak, and smiled up at a photograph
upon his desk, conscious of nothing but
the dull ecstasy which suffused his ample person
and blinded him to everything but the
contemplation of his approaching nuptials.
The watch-chain stretched tightly between his
waistcoat pockets somehow conveyed the impression
of a tension of suppressed emotions,
which threatened to burst their confines. His
rubicund visage exuded delight, and his short
fingers caressed his blond mustache. It was
difficult for him to comprehend that all of
his ambitions were to be realized at once.
Money, of course, would buy almost anything
in New York, but Mr. Geltman had hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
dared to dream of this. Until he had seen
Miss Hazard he had never even thought of
marriage. After he had seen her he had
thought of nothing else.</p>

<p>After working late in his office, Geltman
dined alone at a fashionable restaurant in a
state of beatitude, then lit his cigar and
walked forth into Broadway for a breath of
air before going to bed. The sooner to sleep,
the sooner would his wedding day dawn. But
the glare of the lights distracted him, the bells
jangled out of harmony with his mood, so he
sought a side street and walked on toward the
river, where he could continue his dreams in
quiet, until the hurrying thoroughfare was far
behind.</p>

<p>He had reached a spot between tall warehouses
or factories when he felt himself seized
from behind by strong arms, and before he
could make an outcry something soft was
thrust into his mouth and he had a dim sense
of sudden darkness, of hands not too tender
lifting him into a carriage, a brief whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
order, a hurried drive, more carrying, the
sound of lapping water and ship&rsquo;s bells, the
throbbing of ferry paddles, the motion of a
boat, and the damp night air of the river
through his thin evening clothes.</p>

<p>When Geltman opened his eyes it was to
fix them rather dully upon the deck-beams of
a yacht. The rushing water alongside sent
rapid reflections dancing along their polished
surfaces. At first it occurred to him that he
was on an ocean steamer. Had he been married,
and was this&mdash;? He looked around. No.
He was a good sailor, but the vessel rolled and
pitched sharply in a way to which he was unaccustomed.
He arose to a sitting posture
and tried to piece together the shattered remnants
of his recollection. He felt strangely
stupid and inert. How long had he been
lying in the bunk? He remarked that he was
attired very properly in pajamas&mdash;very fine
pajamas they were, too, of silk such as he wore
himself. Upon the leather-covered bench opposite
was a suit of flannels carefully folded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
white canvas shoes, stockings upon the deck,
and other unfamiliar undergarments disposed
upon hooks by the cabin door.</p>

<p>He rose suddenly, his mind dully trying to
grasp the situation. He lurched to the porthole
and looked out. It was a wilderness of
amber-color and white, rather bewildering
and terrifying seen so near at hand, for Geltman
had been accustomed to look upon the
ocean from the security of fifty feet of freeboard.
Far away where the leaping wave
crests met the line of sky, he could just distinguish
the faint blue of the land. He was
seized with a sudden terror and, turning, he
ran to the cabin door and tried to open it. It
was locked. He threw himself against it and
cried aloud, but his voice was lost in the rush
of wind and water without. His despairing
eye at this moment lit upon a push-button by
the side of the bunk. He touched it with his
finger and anxiously waited. There was no
sound. He sat upon the edge of the bunk,
conscious of a cold wind blowing upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
bare toes and of a dull ache within which proclaimed
the lack of food or drink, or both.
He rang again and renewed his shouting. In
a moment there was the sound of a key in the
lock, the door opened, and a sober, smooth-shaven
person in brass buttons stood in the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ring, sir?&rdquo; said the man, respectfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Geltman, wrathfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Can I get you
anything, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you get me&mdash;?&rdquo; began the bewildered
Geltman. &ldquo;Is there anything you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> get
me? Get me some food&mdash;my own clothes&mdash;and
get me&mdash;get me&mdash;out of this. Where am
I? What am I doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were sleeping, sir,&rdquo; said the man, imperturbably.
&ldquo;I thought you might not wish
to be disturbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Geltman looked around him again as
though unwilling to credit the evidence of
his senses. He saw that the man kept his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
hand upon the door and eyed him narrowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been drugged and shanghaied. What
boat is this? Where are we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re at sea, sir,&rdquo; said the man, quietly.
&ldquo;Off Fire Island, I believe, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire Island,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and this&mdash;&rdquo; as
memory came back with a horrible rush&mdash;&ldquo;what
day is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wednesday, June the twentieth,&rdquo; replied
the man, calmly.</p>

<p>Geltman raised his hands toward the deck
beams and sank upon the bunk on the verge
of collapse. He remembered now&mdash;it was his
wedding day!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p class="cap">As the fog upon his memory still hung
heavily he raised his head toward the
man at the door of the cabin. That
person was eyeing him rather pityingly and
had come a step forward into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I be getting you something, sir?&rdquo; he
was saying again.</p>

<p>Geltman sprang unsteadily to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get out of
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In pajamas, sir?&rdquo; said the man, reproachfully.</p>

<p>Geltman glanced down at the flimsy silk
garment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;in pajamas,&rdquo; he cried, hotly. And
with an imprecation he strode past the outraged
servant and rushed through the saloon
and up the companion. As he raised his head
and shoulders above the deck he was immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
aware of a chill wind which was singing
sharply through the rigging. A gentleman,
in a double-breasted suit and yachting
cap, was standing aft steadying a telescope toward
a distant schooner. By his side was a
short and very stocky man with a bushy red
beard and brass buttons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this outrage?&rdquo; he
cried, wildly addressing the man in the yachting
cap. &ldquo;Are you the owner of this yacht?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman calmly lowered his telescope,
passed it to the bearded man, turned mildly
toward the tousled apparition and looked at
him from top to toe while the sportive wind
gleefully defined Geltman&rsquo;s generous figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, old man,&rdquo; he said, smiling, &ldquo;hadn&rsquo;t
you better get into some clothes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;C&mdash;clothes be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; chattered Geltman.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been drugged, kidnapped, and shanghaied!
Somebody&rsquo;s going to smart for this.
Who are you? What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The enraged brewer, with his arms waving,
his slender garment flapping, his inflamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
countenance and ruffled hair, presented the
wildest appearance imaginable. The man in
the yachting cap wore an expression of commiseration
and exchanged a significant glance
with the red-bearded man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; said he, raising a protesting
hand, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all your friends aboard here.
You&rsquo;re in no danger at all, except&mdash;&rdquo; he
smiled at the brewer&rsquo;s costume&mdash;&ldquo;except from
a bad cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does this outrage mean?&rdquo; cried Geltman
anew. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll suffer for it. As long as
I have a dollar left in the world&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; said the
gentleman. &ldquo;Go below now, that&rsquo;s a good
fellow, get breakfast and some clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll n&mdash;not,&rdquo; said the brewer in chilly
syncopation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Carl Geltman, of Henry
Geltman and Company, and I want an explanation
of this outrage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men exchanged another look, and
the red-bearded one tapped his forehead
twice with a blunt forefinger.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea what you&rsquo;re talking
about, Mr. Fehrenbach,&rdquo; said the man in
the yachting cap, calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fehrenbach!&rdquo; cried the brewer. &ldquo;My
name isn&rsquo;t Fehrenbach!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Otto
Fehrenbach is on the East Side. I&rsquo;m on the
West. My name is Geltman, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man in blue looked gravely down at
the astonished brewer and pushed a bell on
the side of the cabin skylight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was one of the symptoms, Weckerly,&rdquo;
he said aside to the man with the red
beard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Doctor,&rdquo; said the other quizzically.
&ldquo;The sea air ought to do him a lot of good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Geltman, now bewildered, limp and very
much alarmed, suffered himself to be led
shivering below by the two blue-shirted sailor-men.
There he found the steward in the
cabin with a drink, and the blue flannels, and
a boy laying a warm breakfast in the saloon.
He dressed. At table he discovered an appetite
which even his troubled spirit had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
abated. Hot coffee and a cigar completed his
rehabilitation. His situation would have been
an agreeable joke had it not been so tragic.
He had learned enough to feel that he was
powerless, that there had been some terrible
mistake, and that the only way out of the difficulty
was through the somewhat tortuous
and sparsely buoyed channels of diplomacy.</p>

<p>But he walked out upon deck with renewed
confidence. It was early yet. If he could
persuade his host of his mistake there was
still time to run in shore where the telegraph
might set all things right. The man in the
yachting cap was smoking a pipe in the lee
of the after hatch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please tell me your name?&rdquo; began
the brewer, constrainedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all the good will in the world,&rdquo; said
the other, rising. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re feeling
better. I&rsquo;m Doctor Norman Woolf of New
York, and this,&rdquo; indicating the red-bearded
man, &ldquo;is Captain Weckerly of the <i>Pinta</i>.
Captain Weckerly&mdash;Mr. Fehrenbach.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Geltman started at the repetition of the
name, but he gave no other sign.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you mind,&rdquo; said the brewer,
&ldquo;telling me how I came aboard your
boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Woolf, easily. &ldquo;You see,
when I cruise on the <i>Pinta</i> I make it a point
to leave all thought of my cases behind. But
sometimes I break my rule, and when they
told me of yours I made up my mind I should
like to study you under intimate and extraordinary
conditions and so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t quite follow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so I had to bring you out to the yacht
on which I was just starting for a little run
over to the Azores.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Azores!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Woolf was smiling benignly at the unhappy
brewer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;these cases of
aphasia have a peculiar interest for me. It
seems such a little slipping of the cogs.
What&rsquo;s in a name, after all? Yours is an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and honored one. The Fehrenbachs have
made beer for fifty years&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; shouted Geltman springing to
his feet, unable longer to contain himself.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only thirty&mdash;and the stuff isn&rsquo;t fit to
drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray be calm. Don&rsquo;t you know that if
this was to get abroad, it would hurt your
business?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My business&mdash;the business of Geltman
and Company&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The business of Fehrenbach and Company,&rdquo;
interrupted Dr. Woolf sternly.</p>

<p>The unfortunate brewer with an effort contained
himself. He knew that anger would
avail him nothing. The only thing left was
to listen patiently. He subsided again into
his wicker chair and fastened his nervous gaze
upon the distant horizon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to see you capable of self-control.
If you can, I should like you to try
and tell me how you happened to begin using
the name of Geltman.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>How had he happened to use the name of
Geltman!</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you say,&rdquo; continued the Doctor,
without awaiting the answer, &ldquo;if I were
to tell you that I was Christopher Columbus
and that Captain Weckerly here was Francisco
Pizarro or Hernandez Cortes? You&rsquo;d
say we were mistaken, wouldn&rsquo;t you? Of
course you would. When you say that you&rsquo;re
Geltman and we know you&rsquo;re Fehrenbach&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; roared the unhappy brewer,
springing to his feet. &ldquo;Stop, for the love of
Heaven, and let me off this floating madhouse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calm myself! Can you not see that the
whole thing is a terrible mistake? You have
taken me for some one else. Last evening, I
tell you, I was knocked down and drugged.
Then I was carried to a boat and brought
here. Look in my clothes, my handkerchiefs,
my linen, you will see the monogram or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
initials C. G. Will not that be enough to
satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, I assure you you were
brought aboard in the very clothes you now
wear. Even that cap was on your head.
Can&rsquo;t you remember coming up the gangway
with Captain Weckerly?&rdquo; And then, half
aloud, and with looks of misgivings toward
the Captain, who was shaking his head, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
worse than I supposed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Geltman had taken off the yachting cap
and there, perforated in the band, were the letters
O. F. He searched his pockets and found
a handkerchief with the same initials. As he
did so he saw that the two men were looking
at him with a expression of new interest and
concern. His mind was still befogged. For
the first time he really began to doubt himself,
and the evidence of his belated memory. He
had not heard that Otto Fehrenbach was mad.
Was it possible that after all some dreadful
misfortune had happened to him, Geltman?
That a blow he had received in falling had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
turned his mind, and that his soul had migrated
to the body of the hated Fehrenbach?
And if so, did the soul of Fehrenbach occupy
<i>his</i> body? Fehrenbach, sitting in <i>his</i> office,
directing <i>his</i> business with the shoddy
methods of the Fehrenbachs, driving <i>his</i>
horses, and perhaps&mdash;could it be that he was
at this moment marrying Juliet Hazard in
his place? The thought of it made him sick.
He was dimly conscious of some science which
dealt with these things. He had once read a
story of a happening of this kind at a German
university. He looked at these strangers before
him and found himself returning in kind
their mysterious glances. Was he mad? Or
were they? Or were they all mad together?
He glanced aloft at the swaying masts. And
the yacht, too? Was it real or was that, too,
some fantasy of a diseased imagination?
The <i>Fliegende Holländer</i> flitted playfully
into his mind. Just forward of the cabin a
group of sailors were standing looking at him
and whispering. It was uncanny. Were they,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
too, in the same state as the others? It could
not be. The vessel was real. Geltman or
Fehrenbach&mdash;he, himself, was real. There
must be some one aboard the accursed craft
who would listen to him and understand. Bewildered,
he walked forward. As he did so
the group of sailor-men dissolved and each
one hurried about some self-appointed task.
He walked over to a man who was coiling a
rope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, my man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are you from
New York?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the man, but he looked over
his shoulder to right and left as though seeking
a mode of escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever happen to drink any of Geltman&rsquo;s
beer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man gave the brewer one fleeting look,
then dropped his coil and disappeared down
the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;s&rsquo;le hatch.</p>

<p>The brewer watched the retreating figure
with some dismay. He walked toward another
man who was shining some bright work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
around the galley stovepipe. But the man
saw him coming and vanished as the other
had done. An old man with a gray beard sat
on a ditty box at the lee rail, sewing a pair
of breeches. He was chewing tobacco and
scowling, but did not move as the landsman
approached.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, my man,&rdquo; began the brewer again,
&ldquo;did you ever drink any of Geltman&rsquo;s beer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man eyed him from head to foot
before he answered. But there was no fear
in his face&mdash;only pity&mdash;naked and undisguised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; he replied, spitting to leeward.
&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no beer in N&rsquo; York fer me but
Otto Fehrenbach&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Geltman looked at him a moment and then
turned despairingly aft. The yacht was bewitched
and they were all bewitched with
her.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p class="cap">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky Ollie Farquhar&rsquo;s fat,&rdquo; said
Mortimer Crabb when Geltman was
out of earshot. &ldquo;It was neat, Jepson,
beautifully neat. Did you ever see fish take
the bait better? But he&rsquo;ll be coming to in a
minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Jepson was watching the bewildered
brewer. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t get much information
there,&rdquo; he grinned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t last much longer, though,&rdquo; said
Crabb. &ldquo;How much of a run is it to the
coast?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About an hour, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, keep her on her course until eight
bells. Then if he insists we&rsquo;ll run in and land
him on the beach somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will soon be over now. He can&rsquo;t get
in until to-morrow and then&rdquo;&mdash;Crabb beamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
with satisfaction&mdash;&ldquo;and then it&rsquo;ll be too late.
Stow your smile, Jepson. He&rsquo;s coming back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not even this complete chain of circumstantial
evidence could long avail against the
brisk air and sunlight. In the broad expanse
between the thumb and forefinger of his right
hand Geltman noted the blue of some youthful
tattooing. As he saw the familiar letters
doubt took flight. He <i>was</i> himself. There
was no doubt of that. As he went aft again
he smiled triumphantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be done with nonsense, Dr. Woolf,&rdquo;
he growled. &ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; holding his
hand before Crabb&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m Otto Fehrenbach
how is it that the letters C. G. are
marked in my hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb, his arms akimbo, stood looking him
steadily in the eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re awake at
last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at Crabb and the Captain with
eyes which saw not. What he had thought of
saying and doing remained unsaid and undone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
With no other word he lurched heavily
forward and down the companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a hurricane in that quarter,
Jepson, or I&rsquo;m not weather wise,&rdquo; laughed
Crabb. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better run in now. There
isn&rsquo;t much sea and the wind is offshore.
We&rsquo;ll land him at Quogue or Westhampton.
In the meanwhile, keep the tarpaulin over the
for&rsquo;ard boat so that he can&rsquo;t see the name on
her. We&rsquo;ll use the gig. If he tries to peep
over the stern we&rsquo;ll clap him in the stateroom.
It will mean five years at least for me if he
learns the name of the <i>Blue Wing</i>. So look
sharp, Jepson, and keep an eye on him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; said the Captain with a grin,
and walked forward.</p>

<p>Crabb walked the deck in high jubilation.
He looked at his watch. Three o&rsquo;clock! If
McFee had followed his instructions Dicky
Bowles and Juliet Hazard were man and
wife. He had nicely figured his chances. To
Geltman he was Dr. Woolf. To his crew he
was Mr. Crabb taking an unfortunate relative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
for an airing; to Dicky Bowles he was the
rescuer of forlorn damsels and the trump of
good fellows.</p>

<p>Crabb was fully prepared to carry the villainy
through to the end. Of one thing he
was certain, the sooner his guest was off the
<i>Blue Wing</i> and safely landed the better.</p>

<p>And so, when at last Geltman came on deck
with the watchful Weckerly at his heels,
Crabb noted the chastened expression upon
the brewer&rsquo;s face with singular satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go ashore, if you please,&rdquo; he said,
quietly.</p>

<p>Crabb affected disappointed surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here? Now?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pretty far
down the coast. That&rsquo;s Quogue in there. I
can&rsquo;t very well run back to New York, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put me ashore, sir,&rdquo; said Geltman sulkily.</p>

<p>When the gig was lowered, Crabb bowed
the brewer over the side, his evening clothes
tied in a paper package.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said Crabb. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
done with the flannels, Mr. Geltman, send &rsquo;em
to Fehrenbach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Geltman had no reply. He had folded
his arms and was gazing stolidly toward the
shore. The last glimpse Crabb had of him
was when the <i>Blue Wing</i> drew offshore leaving
him gesticulating wildly upon the beach in
the glow of the setting sun.</p>

<p>When the figure was but a speck in the distance
Mortimer Crabb turned away and threw
himself wearily in his wicker chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where to now, sir?&rdquo; asked Jepson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, anywhere you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sandy Hook, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;as well go there as
anywhere else. New York, Jepson.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Poor Crabb! In twenty-four hours he was,
if anything, more bored than ever. The sight
of the joyous faces of Dicky Bowles and his
bride had done something to relieve the
<i>tedium vitæ</i>, but he knew that their joy was
of themselves and not of him, and so he gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
them a &ldquo;God bless you&rdquo; and his country place
on Long Island for a few weeks of honeymooning.
He had even had the presumption
to offer them the <i>Blue Wing</i>, but Dicky,
whose new responsibilities had developed a
vein of prudence, refused point blank. Crabb
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suit yourselves,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s yours
if you want it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And have Geltman putting you in jail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>he</i> won&rsquo;t trouble me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made some inquiries. He&rsquo;s dropped
the thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. He&rsquo;s not so thick-skinned as he
looks. That story wouldn&rsquo;t look well in print,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With an outburst of friendship, Dicky
threw his arms around Crabb&rsquo;s shoulders and
gave him a bear hug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget it, Mort, never! You&rsquo;re
the salt of the earth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there, Dicky. Salt should be taken
in pinches, not by the spoonful, and you&rsquo;ve
mussed my cravat! Be off with you and don&rsquo;t
come back here until matrimony has sobered
you into a proper sense of your new responsibilities
to your Creator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the window of his apartment Crabb
watched Dicky&rsquo;s taxi spin up the avenue in
the direction of the modest boarding-house
which sheltered the waiting bride, then turned
with a heavy sigh and rang for McFee. Love
like that never comes to the very rich. He,
Mortimer Crabb, was not a sentient being,
but only a chattel, an animated bank account
upon which designing matrons cast envious
eyes and for which ambitious daughters laid
their pretty snares. No, love like that was
not for him&mdash;or ever would be, it seemed.</p>

<p>His toilet made, Crabb strolled out for the
air, wondering as he often did how the people
on the street could smile their way through
life, while he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A hansom passed, turned just beyond and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
drew up at the curb beside him, and a voice
addressed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crabb! Mortimer Crabb! By all that&rsquo;s
lucky!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ross Burnett!&rdquo; said Crabb, gladly. &ldquo;I
thought that you were dead. Have you
dropped from heaven, man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; laughed Ross, &ldquo;not so far, only from
China.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett dismissed the hansom at once and
together they went to the Bachelors&rsquo; Club
near by, where, over a friendly glass, they
gathered up the loose ends of their friendship.
Crabb listened with new interest as his old
friend gave him an account of what had happened
in the five years which had intervened
since they had last met, recalling piece by
piece the unfortunate events which had led
to his departure from New York, and Burnett,
glad of receptive ears, rehearsed it for
him.</p>

<p>The boy had squandered his patrimony in
Wall Street. Then by the grace of one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
senators from New York he obtained from
the President an appointment as consular
clerk, an office, which if it paid but little at
home carried with it some dignity, a little authority,
and certain appreciable perquisites in
foreign ports.</p>

<p>He had chosen wisely. At Cairo, where
he had been sent to fill a temporary vacancy
caused by the death of the consul general and
subsequent illness of his deputy, he found himself
suddenly in charge of the consular office
in the fullest press of business, with diplomatic
functions requiring both ingenuity and
discretion.</p>

<p>After all, it was very simple. The business
of a consulate was child&rsquo;s play, and the usual
phases in the life of a diplomat were to be
requisitely met by the usages of gentility&mdash;a
quality Burnett discovered was not too amply
possessed by those political gentlemen who sat
abroad in the posts of honor to represent the
great republic.</p>

<p>He thought that if he could get a post,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
however small, with plenary powers, he would
be happy. But, alas! He had been away from
home so long that he didn&rsquo;t even know whether
his senator was dead or alive, and when he
reached Washington, a month or so after the
inauguration, he realized how small were his
chances for preferment.</p>

<p>The President and Secretary of State were
besieged daily by powerful politicians, and
one by one the posts coveted, even the
smallest of them, were taken by frock-coated,
soft-hatted, flowing-tied gentlemen, whom he
had noticed lounging and chewing tobacco in
the Willard Hotel lobby. It was apparently
with such persons that power took preferment.
His roseate dreams vanished. Ross
Burnett was a mere State Department drudge
again at twelve hundred a year!</p>

<p>He told Crabb that he had spoken to the
chief of the diplomatic bureau in despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any way, Crowthers?&rdquo; he had
asked. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t a fellow ever get any higher?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he had a pull, he might&mdash;but a consular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
clerk&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The shake of Crowthers&rsquo; head
was eloquent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there anything a fellow&mdash;even a consular
clerk&mdash;could do to win promotion in
this service?&rdquo; he continued.</p>

<p>Crowthers had looked at him quizzically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s one thing. If you could do
that, you might ask the Secretary for anything
you wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get the text of the treaty between Germany
and China from Baron Arnim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crowthers had chuckled. Crabb chuckled,
too. He thought it a very good joke. Baron
Arnim had been the special envoy of Germany
to China, accredited to the court of
the Eastern potentate with the special mission
of formulating a new and secret treaty between
these monarchs. He was now returning
home carrying a copy of this document in
his baggage.</p>

<p>Burnett had laughed. It <i>was</i> a good joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better send me out again,&rdquo; Burnett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
had said, hopelessly. &ldquo;Anything from
Arakan to Zanzibar will do for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb listened to the story with renewed
marks of appreciation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve been out and doing in the world,
after all?&rdquo; he said, languidly, &ldquo;while we&mdash;<i>eheu
jam satis!</i>&mdash;have glutted ourselves with
the stale and unprofitable. How I envy you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett smoked silently. It was very easy
to envy from the comfortable vantage ground
of a hundred and fifty thousand a year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, man, if you knew how sick of it all
I am,&rdquo; sighed Crabb, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d thank your stars
for the lucky dispensation that took you out
of it. Rasselas was right. I&rsquo;ve been pursuing
the phantoms of hope for thirty years, and I&rsquo;m
still hopeless. There have been a few bright
spots&rdquo;&mdash;Crabb smiled at his cigar ash&mdash;&ldquo;a
very few, and far between.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bored as ever, Crabb?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Immitigably. To live in the thick of
things and see nothing but the pale drabs and
grays. No red anywhere. Oh, for a passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
that would burn and sear&mdash;love, hate, fear!
I&rsquo;m forever courting them all. And here I
am still cool, colorless and unscarred. Only
once&rdquo;&mdash;his gray eyes lit up marvelously&mdash;&ldquo;only
once did I learn the true relation of
life to death, Burnett; only once. That was
when the <i>Blue Wing</i> struggled six days in a
hurricane with Hatteras under her lee. It
was glorious. They may talk of love and hate
as they will; fear, I tell you, is the Titan of
passions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett was surprised at this unmasking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should try big game,&rdquo; he said, carelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;both beasts and
men&mdash;and here I am in flannels and a red tie!
I&rsquo;ve skinned the one and been skinned by the
other&mdash;to what end?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve bought experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheap at any cost. You can&rsquo;t buy fear.
Love comes in varieties at the market values.
Hate can be bought for a song; but fear, genuine
and amazing, is priceless&mdash;a gem which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
only opportunity can provide; and how seldom
opportunity knocks at any man&rsquo;s door!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crabb the original&mdash;the esoteric!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. The same. The very same. And
you, how different! How sober and
rounded!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a silence, contemplative, retrospective
on both their parts. Crabb broke it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, old man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;about your
position. Isn&rsquo;t there any chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett smiled a little bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a consular clerk at twelve hundred a
year during good behavior. When I&rsquo;ve said
that, I&rsquo;ve said it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your future?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in line of promotion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible! Politics?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. I&rsquo;ve no pull to speak of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your service?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been paid for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any other way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Burnett laughed, &ldquo;that treaty.
I happened to know something about it when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
I was out there. It has to do with neutrality,
trade ports and coaling stations; but just what,
the devil only knows, and his deputy, Baron
Arnim, won&rsquo;t tell. Arnim is now in Washington,
ostensibly sight-seeing, but really to
confer with Von Schlichter, the ambassador
there, about it. You see, we&rsquo;ve got rather
more closely into the Eastern question than
we really like, and a knowledge of Germany&rsquo;s
attitude is immensely important to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray go on,&rdquo; drawled Crabb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all there is. The rest was a joke.
Crowthers wants me to get the text of that
treaty from Baron Arnim&rsquo;s dispatch-box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Entertaining!&rdquo; said Crabb, with clouding
brow. And then, after a pause, with all
the seriousness in the world: &ldquo;And aren&rsquo;t
you going to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett turned to look at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get it. The treaty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The treaty! From Baron Arnim! You
don&rsquo;t know much of diplomacy, Crabb.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You misunderstood me,&rdquo; he said, coolly;
and then, with lowered voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not from Baron Arnim&mdash;from Baron
Arnim&rsquo;s dispatch-box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett looked at his acquaintance in a maze.
Crabb had been thought a mystery in the old
days. He was an enigma now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;re jesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? It oughtn&rsquo;t to be difficult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett looked fearfully around the room
at their distant neighbors. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s burglary.
Worse than that. If I, in my connection with
the State Department, were discovered tampering
with the papers of a foreign government,
it would lead to endless complications
and, perhaps, the disruption of diplomatic relations.
Such a thing is impossible. Its very
impossibility was the one thing which
prompted Crowthers&rsquo; suggestion. Can&rsquo;t you
understand that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb was stroking his chin and contemplating
his well-shaped boot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Admit that it&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; he said calmly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
&ldquo;Do you think, if by some chance you were
enabled to give the Secretary of State this information,
you&rsquo;d better your condition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the use, Crabb?&rdquo; began Burnett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t do any harm to answer me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes, I suppose so. If we weren&rsquo;t
plunged immediately into war with Emperor
William.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Crabb was deep in thought. It was
several moments before he went on, and then,
as though dismissing the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are your plans, Ross? Have you a
week to spare? How about a cruise on the
<i>Blue Wing</i>? There&rsquo;s a lot I know that you
don&rsquo;t, and a lot you know that I&rsquo;d like to. I&rsquo;ll
take you up to Washington whenever you&rsquo;re
bored. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ross Burnett accepted with alacrity. He
remembered the <i>Blue Wing</i>, Jepson and Valentin&rsquo;s
dinners. He had longed for them
many times when he was eating spaghetti at
Gabri&rsquo;s little restaurant in Genoa.</p>

<p>When they parted it was with a consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
on the part of Burnett that the affair of
Baron Arnim had not been dismissed. The
very thought had been madness. Was it only
a little pleasantry of Crabb&rsquo;s? If not, what
wild plan had entered his head? It was unlike
the Mortimer Crabb he remembered.</p>

<p>And yet there had been a deeper current
flowing below his placid surface that gave a
suggestion of desperate intent which nothing
could explain away. And how illimitable
were the possibilities if some plan could be devised
by which the information could be obtained
without resort to violent measures! It
meant for him at least a post at the helm somewhere,
or, perhaps, a secretaryship on one of
the big commissions.</p>

<p>The idea of burglary, flagrant and nefarious,
he dismissed at a thought. Would there
not be some way&mdash;an unguarded moment&mdash;a
faithless servant&mdash;to give the thing the aspect
of possible achievement? As he dressed he
found himself thinking of the matter with
more seriousness than it deserved.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p class="cap">A week had passed since the two
friends had met, and the <i>Blue Wing</i>
now lay in the Potomac near the
Seventh Street wharf. It was night and the
men had dined.</p>

<p>Valentin&rsquo;s dinners were a distinct achievement.
They were of the kind which made
conclusive the assumption of an especial
heaven for cooks. After coffee and over a
cigar, which made all things complete, Mortimer
Crabb chose his psychological moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burnett,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must see that
treaty and copy it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett looked at him squarely. Crabb&rsquo;s
glance never wavered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you <i>did</i> mean it?&rdquo; said Burnett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every word. You must have it. I&rsquo;m going
to help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hopeless.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But the game is worth the candle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bribe to a servant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me. Come, come, Ross, it&rsquo;s
the chance of your life. Arnim, Von Schlichter
and all the rest of them dine at the British
embassy to-night. There&rsquo;s to be a ball afterward.
They won&rsquo;t be back until late. We
must get into Arnim&rsquo;s rooms at the German
embassy. Those rooms are in the rear of the
house. There&rsquo;s a rain spout and a back building.
You can climb?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo; Burnett gasped. &ldquo;You found
out these things to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since I left you. I saw Denton Thorpe
at the British embassy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you were so sure I&rsquo;d agree! Don&rsquo;t
you think, old man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it all, Burnett! I&rsquo;m not easily deceived.
You&rsquo;re down on your luck; that&rsquo;s
plain. But you&rsquo;re not beaten. Any man who
can buck the market down to his last thousand
the way you did doesn&rsquo;t lack sand. The end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
isn&rsquo;t an ignoble one. You&rsquo;ll be doing the Administration
a service&mdash;and yourself. Why,
how can you pause?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett looked around at the familiar fittings
of the saloon, at the Braun prints let
into the woodwork, at the flying teal set in
the azure above the wainscoting, at his immaculate
host and at his own conventional
black. Was this to be indeed a setting for
Machiavellian conspiracy?</p>

<p>Crabb got up from the table and opened the
doors of a large locker under the companion.
Burnett watched him curiously.</p>

<p>Garment after garment he pulled out upon
the deck under the glare of the cabin lamp;
shoes, hats and caps, overcoats and clothing of
all sizes and shapes from the braided gray
of the coster to the velvet and sash of
the Niçois.</p>

<p>He selected a soft hat and a cap and two
long, tattered coats of ancient cut and style
and threw them over the back of a chair.
Then he went to his stateroom and brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
out a large square box of tin and placed it on
the table.</p>

<p>He first wrapped a handkerchief around
his neck, then seated himself deliberately before
the box, opened the lid and took out a
tray filled with make-up sticks. These he put
aside while he drew forth from the deeper
recesses mustachios, whiskers and beards of
all shapes and complexions. He worked rapidly
and silently, watching his changing image
in the little mirror set in the box lid.</p>

<p>Burnett, fascinated, followed his skillful
fingers as they moved back and forth, lining
here, shading there, not as the actor does for
an effect by the calcium, but carefully, delicately,
with the skill of the art anatomist who
knows the bone structure of the face and the
pull of the aging muscles.</p>

<p>In twenty minutes Mortimer Crabb had
aged as many years, and now bore the phiz
of a shaggy rum-sot. The long coat, soft hat
and rough bandanna completed the character.
The fever of the adventure had mounted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Burnett&rsquo;s veins. He sprang to his feet with a
reckless gesture of final resolution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me my part!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
play it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The aged intemperate smiled approval.
&ldquo;Good lad!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d be
game. If you hadn&rsquo;t been I was going alone.
It&rsquo;s lucky you&rsquo;re clean shaved. Come and be
transfigured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as he rapidly worked on Burnett&rsquo;s face
he completed the details of his plan. Like a
good general, Crabb disposed his plans for
failure as well as for success.</p>

<p>They would wear their disguises over their
evening clothes. Then, if the worst came,
vaseline and a wipe of the bandannas would
quickly remove all guilty signs from their
faces, they could discard their tatters, and resume
the garb of convention.</p>

<p>Ross Burnett at last rose swarthy and darkly
mustached, lacking only the rings in his ears
to be old Gabri himself. He was fully awakened
to the possibilities of the adventure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Whatever misgivings he had had were speedily
dissipated by the blithe optimism of his
companion.</p>

<p>Crabb reached over for the brandy decanter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One drink,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and we must be off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The night was thick. A mist which had
been gathering since sunset now turned to a
soft drizzle of rain. Crabb, hands in pockets
and shoulders bent, walked with a rapid and
shambling gait up the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t risk the cars or a cab in this,&rdquo;
muttered Crabb. &ldquo;We might do it, but it&rsquo;s not
worth the risk. Can you walk? It&rsquo;s not over
three miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was after one o&rsquo;clock before they
reached Highland Terrace. Without stopping
they examined the German embassy at
long range from the distant side of Massachusetts
Avenue. A gas lamp sputtered dimly
under the <i>porte-cochère</i>. Another light
gleamed far up in the slanting roof. Crabb
led the way around and into the alley in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
rear. It was long, badly lighted and ran the
entire length of the block.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got the details in the city plot-book from
a real-estate man this afternoon. He thinks
I&rsquo;m going to buy next door. I wanted to be
particular about the alleys and back entrances.&rdquo;
Crabb chuckled.</p>

<p>Burnett looked along the backs of the row
of N Street houses. They were all as stolid
as sphinxes. Several lights at wide intervals
burned dimly. The night was chill for the
season, and all the windows were down. The
occasion was propitious. The rear of the embassy
was dark, except for a dim glow in a
window on the second floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That should be Arnim&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; said
Crabb.</p>

<p>He tried the back gate. It was unlocked.
Noiselessly they entered, closing it after them.
There was a rain spout, which Crabb eyed
hopefully; but they found better luck in the
shape of a thirty-foot ladder along the fence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A positive invitation,&rdquo; whispered Crabb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
joyfully. &ldquo;Here, Ross; in the shadow. Once
on the back building the deed is done. Quiet,
now. You hold it and I&rsquo;ll go up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett did not falter. But his hands were
cold, and he was trembling from top to toe
with excitement. He could not but admire
Crabb&rsquo;s composure as he went firmly up the
rungs.</p>

<p>He saw him reach the roof and draw himself
over the coping, and in a moment Burnett,
less noiselessly but safely, had joined his
fellow criminal by the window. There they
waited a moment, listening. A cab clattered
down Fifteenth Street, and the gongs on the
car line clanged in reply, but that was all.</p>

<p>Crabb stealthily arose and peered into the
lighted window. It was a study. The light
came from a lamp with a green shade. Under
its glow upon the desk were maps and
documents in profusion. And in the corner
he could make out the lines of an iron-bound
chest or box. They had made no mistake.
Unless in the possession of Von Schlichter it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
was here that the Chinese treaty would be
found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; whispered Crabb. &ldquo;An old-fashioned
padlock, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb tried the window. It was locked.
He took something from one of the pockets
of his coat and reached up to the middle of
the sash. There was a sound like the quick
shearing of linen which sent the blood back
to Burnett&rsquo;s heart. In the still night it seemed
to come back manifold from the wings of the
buildings opposite. They paused again. A
slight crackling of broken glass, and Crabb&rsquo;s
long fingers reached through the hole and
turned the catch. In a moment they were in
the room.</p>

<p>The intangible and Quixotic had become a
latter-day reality. Burnett&rsquo;s spirits rose. He
did not lack courage, and here was a situation
which spurred him to the utmost.</p>

<p>Instinctively he closed the inside shutters
behind him. From the alley the pair would
not have presented an appearance which accorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with the quiet splendor of the room.
He found himself peering around, his ears
straining for the slightest sound.</p>

<p>A glance revealed the dispatch-box, heavy,
squat and phlegmatic, like its owner. Crabb
had tiptoed over to the door of the adjoining
room. Burnett saw the eyes dilate and the
warning finger to his lips.</p>

<p>From the inner apartment, slowly and
regularly, came the sound of heavy breathing.
There, in a broad armchair by the foot of the
bed, sprawled the baron&rsquo;s valet, in stertorous
sleep. His mouth was wide open, his limbs
relaxed. He had heard nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; whispered Crabb; &ldquo;your bandanna
around his legs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett surprised himself by the rapidity
and intelligence of his collaboration. A handkerchief
was slipped into the man&rsquo;s mouth,
and before his eyes were fairly opened he was
gagged and bound hand and foot by the cord
from the baron&rsquo;s own dressing gown.</p>

<p>From a pocket Crabb had produced a revolver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
which he flourished significantly under
the nose of the terrified man, who recoiled before
the dark look which accompanied it.</p>

<p>Crabb seemed to have planned exactly what
to do. He took a bath towel and tied it over
the man&rsquo;s ears and under his chin. From the
bed he took the baron&rsquo;s sheets and blankets,
enswathing the unfortunate servant until
nothing but the tip of his nose was visible. A
rope of suspenders and cravats completed the
job.</p>

<p>The Baron Arnim&rsquo;s valet, to all the purposes
of usefulness in life, was a bundled
mummy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; said Crabb, when it was done.
&ldquo;Poor devil! But it can&rsquo;t be helped. He
mustn&rsquo;t see or know. And now for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb produced a bunch of skeleton keys
and an electric bull&rsquo;s-eye. He tried the keys
rapidly. In a moment the dispatch-box was
opened and its contents exposed to view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carefully now,&rdquo; whispered Crabb. &ldquo;What
should it look like?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A foolscap-shaped thing in silk covers
with dangling cords,&rdquo; said Ross. &ldquo;There, under
your hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a moment they had it out and between
them on the desk. There it was, in all truth,
written in two columns, Chinese on the one
side, French on the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; said Crabb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! Sure as I&rsquo;m a thief in the night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then sit and write, man. Write as you
never wrote before. I&rsquo;ll listen and watch
Rameses the Second.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the twenty minutes during which Burnett
fearfully wrote, Crabb stood listening at
the doors and windows for sounds of servants
or approaching carriages. The man swaddled
in the sheets made a few futile struggles
and then subsided. Burnett&rsquo;s eyes gleamed.
Other eyes than his would gleam at what he
saw and wrote. When he finished he closed
the document, removed all traces of his work,
replaced it in the iron box and shut the lid.
He dropped the precious sheets into an inner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
pocket and was moving toward the window
when Crabb seized him by the arm. There
was a step in the hallway without, and the
door opened. There, stout and grizzled, his
walrus mustache bristling with surprise, in all
the distinction of gold lace and orders, stood
Baron Arnim.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p class="cap">For a moment there was no sound. The
burglars looked at the Baron and the
Baron looked at the burglars, mouths
and eyes open alike. Then, even before Crabb
could display his intimidating revolver, the
German had disappeared through the door
screaming at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick! Out of the window!&rdquo; said Crabb,
helping Burnett over the sill. &ldquo;Down you
go&mdash;I&rsquo;ll follow. Don&rsquo;t fall. If you miss your
footing, we&rsquo;re ruined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett scrambled out, over the coping and
down the ladder, Crabb almost on his fingers.
But they reached the yard in safety and were
out in the alley running in the shadow of the
fence before a venturesome head stuck forth
from the open window and a revolver blazed
into the vacant air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; said Crabb. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
every copper in the city on us in a minute.
This way.&rdquo; He turned into a narrow alley at
right angles to the other. &ldquo;Off with the coat
as you go&mdash;now, the mustache and grease
paint. Take your time. Into this sewer with
the coats. So!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two gentlemen in light topcoats, one in a
cap, the other in a hat, walked up N street
arm in arm, thickly singing. Their shirt
fronts and hair were rumpled, their legs were
not too steady, and they clung affectionately
to each other for support and sang thickly.</p>

<p>A window flew up and a tousled head appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; yelled a voice. &ldquo;Burglars in the alley!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burglars!&rdquo; said one of the singers; and
then: &ldquo;Go to bed. You&rsquo;re drunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More sounds of windows, the blowing of
night whistles and hurrying feet.</p>

<p>Still the revelers sang on.</p>

<p>A stout policeman, clamorous and bellicose,
broke in.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see &rsquo;em? Did you see &rsquo;em?&rdquo; he
cried, glaring into their faces. Bleary eyes
returned his look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-who?&rdquo; said the voices in unison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burglars,&rdquo; roared the copper. &ldquo;If I
wasn&rsquo;t busy I&rsquo;d run ye in.&rdquo; And he was off
at full speed on his vagrant mission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucky you&rsquo;re busy, old chap,&rdquo; muttered
Crabb to the departing figure. &ldquo;Do sober up
a little, Ross, or we&rsquo;ll never get away. And
don&rsquo;t jostle me so, for I clank like a bellwether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly the pair made their way to Thomas
Circle and Vermont Avenue, where the
sounds of commotion were lost in the noises
of the night.</p>

<p>At L Street Burnett straightened up.
&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;But that was close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as close as it looked,&rdquo; said Crabb,
coolly. &ldquo;A white shirt-front does wonders
with a copper. It was better than a knock on
the head and a run for it. In the meanwhile,
Ross, for the love of Heaven, help me with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
some of the bric-à-brac.&rdquo; And with that he
handed Burnett a gold pin tray, a silver box
and a watch fob.</p>

<p>Burnett soberly examined the spoils. &ldquo;I
only wish we could have done without
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And had Arnim know what we were driving
for? Never, Ross. I&rsquo;ll pawn them in
New York for as little as I can and send
von Schlichter the tickets. Won&rsquo;t that do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it must,&rdquo; said Burnett, dubiously.</p>

<p>By three o&rsquo;clock they were on the <i>Blue
Wing</i> again, Burnett with mingled feelings of
doubt and satisfaction, Crabb afire with the
achievement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rasselas was a fool, Ross, a malcontent&mdash;a
<i>fainéant</i>. Life is amazing, bewitching, consummate.&rdquo;
And then, gayly: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a
health, boy&mdash;a long life to the new ambassador
to the Court of St. James!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But Ross did not go to the Court of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
James. In the following winter, to the surprise
of many, the President gave him a special
mission to prepare a trade treaty with
Peru. Baron Arnim, in due course, recovered
his bric-à-brac. Meanwhile Emperor William,
mystified at the amazing sagacity of the
Secretary of State in the Eastern question,
continues the building of a mighty navy in the
fear that one day the upstart nation across the
ocean will bring the questions complicating
them to an issue.</p>

<p>But life was no longer amusing, bewitching
or consummate to Crabb. The flavor of
an adventure gone from his mouth, the commonplace
became more flat and tasteless than
before. Life was all pale drabs and grays
again. To make matters worse he had been
obliged to make a business visit in Philadelphia,
and this filled the cup of insipidity to
the brim. He was almost ready to wish that
his benighted forbears had never owned the
coal mines in Pennsylvania to which he had
fallen heir, for it seemed there were many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
matters to be settled, contracts to be signed
and leases to be drawn by his attorney in the
sleepy city, and it would be several days, he
discovered, before he could get off to Newport.
Not even the <i>Blue Wing</i> was at his
disposal, for an accident in the engine room
had laid her out of commission for two weeks
at least.</p>

<p>So he resigned himself to the inevitable, and
took a room at a hotel, grimly determined to
see the matter through, conscious meanwhile
of a fervid hope that the unusual might happen&mdash;the
lightning might strike. Hate he had
known and fear, but love had so far eluded
him. Why, he did not know, save that he
had never been willing to perceive that emotion
when offered in conventional forms&mdash;and
since no other forms were possible, he had
simply ceased to consider the matter. Yet
marry some day, he must, of course. But
whom? Little he dreamed how soon he would
know. Little did Miss Patricia Wharton
think that she had anything to do with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
In fact, Patricia&rsquo;s thoughts at that time were
far from matrimony. Patricia was bored.
For a month while Wharton père boiled out
his gout at the sulphur springs, Patricia had
dutifully sat and rocked, tapping a small foot
impatiently, looking hourly less a monument
of Patience and smiling not at all.</p>

<p>At last they were in Philadelphia. Wilson
had opened two rooms at the house and a
speedy termination of David Wharton&rsquo;s business
would have seen them soon at Bar Harbor.
But something went wrong at the office
in Chestnut Street, and Patricia, once a lamb
and now a sheep of sacrifice, found herself at
this particular moment doomed to another
weary week of waiting.</p>

<p>To make matters worse not a girl Patricia
knew was in town, or if there were any the
telephone refused to discover them. Her
aunt&rsquo;s place was at Haverford, but she knew
that an invitation to dinner there meant aged
Quaker cousins and that kind of creaky informality
which shows a need of oil at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
joints. That lubricant Patricia had no intention
of supplying. She had rather be bored
alone than bored in company. She found herself
sighing for Bar Harbor as she had never
sighed before. She pictured the cottage, cool
and gray among the rocks, the blue bowl of
the sea with its rim just at her window-ledge,
the clamoring surf, and the briny smell with
its faint suggestion of things cool and curious
which came up newly breathed from the heart
of the deep. She could hear &ldquo;Country Girl&rdquo;
whinnying impatience from the stable when
Jack Masters on &ldquo;Kentucky&rdquo; rode down from
&ldquo;The Pinnacle&rdquo; to inquire.</p>

<p>Indeed, as she walked out into the Square
in the afternoon she found herself relapsing
into a minute and somewhat sordid introspection.
It was the weather, perhaps. Surely the
dog-days had settled upon the sleepy city in
earnest. No breath stirred the famishing
trees, the smell of hot asphalt was in the air,
locusts buzzed vigorously everywhere, trolley
bells clanged out of tune, and the sun was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
leaving a blood-hot trail across the sky in
angry augury for the morrow.</p>

<p>Patricia sank upon a bench, and poked viciously
at the walk with her parasol. She experienced
a certain grim satisfaction in being
more than usually alone. Poor Patricia! who
at the crooking of a finger, could have summoned
to her side any one of five estimable
scions of stupid, distinguished families. Only
something new, something difficult and extraordinary
would lift her from the hopeless
slough of despond into which she had found
herself precipitated.</p>

<p>Andromeda awaiting Perseus on a bench in
Rittenhouse Square! She smiled widely and
unrestrainedly up and precisely into the face
of Mr. Mortimer Crabb.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p class="cap">A pleasant face it was, upon
which, to her surprise, a smile very
suddenly grew into being as though
in response to her own. Patricia&rsquo;s eyes
dropped quickly&mdash;sedately, as became those
of a decorous woman, and yet in that brief
second in which the eyes of the tall young
man met hers, she had noticed that they were
gray, as though sun-bleached, but very clear
and sparkling. And when she raised her own
to look quite through and beyond the opposite
bench, her conscience refused to deny that she
had enjoyed the looking. Were the eyes
smiling <i>at</i>, or <i>with</i> her? In that distinction
lay a question in morals. Was their sparkle
quizzical or intrusive? She would have
vowed that good humor, benevolence (if benevolence
may be found in the eyes of two
and thirty), and a certain polite interest were<span class="ispan pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
its actual ingredients. It was all very interesting.
She surprised herself in a not unlively
curiosity as to his life and calling, and
in a lack of any sort of misgiving at the <i>contretemps</i>.</p>

<p>The shadows beneath the wilted trees grew
deeper. The sun swept down into the west
and suddenly vanished with all his train of
gold and purple. Patricia stole a furtive look
at her neighbor. Triumphantly she confirmed
her diagnosis. The man was lost in the glow
of the sunset. Importunity and he were miles
asunder.</p>

<p>It may have been that Patricia&rsquo;s eyes were
more potent than the sunset, or that her
triumphant deduction was based upon a false
premise, or that the young man had been
watching her all the while from the tail of his
benevolent eye; for without the slightest
warning, his head turned suddenly to find the
eyes of the unfortunate Patricia again fixed
upon his. However quickly she might turn
aside, the glance exchanged was long enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to disclose the fact that the sparkle was still
there and to excite a suspicion that it had
never been dispelled. Nor did the character
of the smile reassure her. She was not at all
certain now that he was not smiling both <i>with</i>
and <i>at</i> her.</p>

<p>The quickly averted head, the toss of the
chin, seemed all too inadequate to the situation;
yet she availed herself of those bulwarks
of maiden modesty in virtuous effort to refute
the unconscious testimony of her unlucky eyes.
Instinct suggested immediate flight. But
Patricia moved not. Here indeed was a case
where flight meant confession. She felt rather
than saw his gaze search her from head to
foot, and struggle as she might against it, the
warm color raced to her cheek and brow. If
she had enjoyed the situation a moment before,
the impertinence, so suddenly born, filled
her with dismay. By some subtle feminine
process of reasoning, she succeeded in eliminating
her share in the trifling adventure and
now saw only the sin of the offending male.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
At last she arose, the very presentment of injured
and scornful dignity and walked, looking
neither to the left hand nor to the right.</p>

<p>There was a sound of firm, rapid footsteps
and then a deep voice at her elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; it was saying.</p>

<p>The lifted straw hat, the inclined head, the
mellow tones, the gray eyes (again benevolent),
however unalarming in themselves,
filled her with very real inquietude. Whatever
he had done before, this, surely, was insupportable.
She was about to turn away
when her eye fell upon his extended arm and
upon her luckless parasol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<a href="#image02">I beg pardon,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;but isn&rsquo;t this
yours?</a>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;">
<a name="image02" id="image02">
<img src="images/image02.jpg" width="360" height="600" alt="&ldquo;&lsquo;I beg pardon,&rsquo; he repeated, &lsquo;but isn&rsquo;t this yours?&rsquo;&rdquo;" title="&ldquo;&lsquo;I beg pardon,&rsquo; he repeated, &lsquo;but isn&rsquo;t this yours?&rsquo;&rdquo;" /></a><br />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;<a href="#Page_66">I beg pardon,&rsquo; he repeated, &lsquo;but isn&rsquo;t this yours?</a>&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>The blood flew to her face again and it was
with an embarrassment, a <i>gaucherie</i>, the like
of which she could not remember, that she extended
her hand toward the errant sunshade.
No sound came from her lips; with bent head
she took it from him. But as she walked on,
she found that he was walking, too&mdash;with her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
directly at her side. For a moment she was
cold with terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll let me go along,&rdquo; he was saying
coolly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really quite harmless. If you
knew&mdash;if you only knew how dreadfully bored
I&rsquo;ve been, you really wouldn&rsquo;t mind me at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia stole a hurried glance at him, her
fears curiously diminished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m what the fallen call a victim of circumstances,&rdquo;
he went on. &ldquo;I ask no worse fate
for my dearest enemy than to be consigned
without a friend to this wilderness of whitened
stoops and boarded doors&mdash;to wait upon
your city&rsquo;s demigod, Procrastination. This
I&rsquo;ve done for forty-eight hours with a dear
memory of a past but without a hope for the
future. If the Fountain of Youth were to
gush hopefully from the office water-cooler of
my aged lawyer, he would eye it askance and
sigh for the lees of the turbid Schuylkill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However she strove to lift her brows,
Patricia was smiling now in spite of herself.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve followed the meandering tide down
the narrow cañon you call Chestnut Street,
watched the leisurely coal wagon and its attendant
tail of trolleys, or sat in my hotel
striving to dust aside the accumulating cobwebs,
one small unquiet molecule of disconsolation.
I&rsquo;m stranded&mdash;marooned. By comparison,
Crusoe was gregarious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During this while they were walking
north. All the way to Chestnut Street, Patricia
was wondering whether to be most
alarmed or amused. Of one thing she was assured,
she was bored no longer. A sense of
the violence done to her traditions hung like a
millstone around her neck; and yet Patricia
found herself peeping avidly through the
hole to listen to the seductive voice of unconvention.</p>

<p>When Patricia succeeded in summoning
her voice, she was not quite sure that it was
her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an impertinent person,&rdquo; she found
herself saying.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you forgive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Circumstances are against me,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but I give you my word, I&rsquo;ve a place in my
own city, a friend or two, and a certain proclivity
for virtue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if you do&mdash;speak to strange&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t. It was the blessed parasol.
Otherwise I shouldn&rsquo;t have dared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the proclivity for virtue&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s exactly the reason. Can&rsquo;t you
see? It was you! You fairly exuded gentility.
Come now, I&rsquo;m humility itself. I&rsquo;ve
sinned. How can I expiate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By letting me go home to dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia was laughing this time. The man
was looking at his watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a brute I am!&rdquo; He stopped, took
off his hat and turned away. And here it was
that some little frivolous genius put unmeditated
words upon Patricia&rsquo;s tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so dreadfully hungry,&rdquo; she
said.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>After all, he had been impertinent so very
courteously.</p>

<p>In a moment he was at her side again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was kind of you. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve
forgiven me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no,&rdquo; with rising inflection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come now! Let&rsquo;s be friends, just for this
little while. Let&rsquo;s begin at once to believe
we&rsquo;ve known each other always&mdash;just for to-night.
I will be getting out of town to-morrow
and we won&rsquo;t meet again. I&rsquo;m certain of
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I be sure?&rdquo; Patricia spoke as
though thinking aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve promised me this time. I&rsquo;ll go
away to-morrow. If my papers aren&rsquo;t ready
I&rsquo;ll leave without them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you give me your word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia turned for the first time and looked
directly up at him. What value could she
set upon the honor of one she knew not?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Whatever the feminine process of examination,
she seemed satisfied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can I do? It&rsquo;s almost dusk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was about to suggest&mdash;er&mdash;I thought
perhaps you might be willing to&mdash;er&mdash;go and
have a bite&mdash;to eat&mdash;in fact, dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia stopped and looked up at him in
startled abstraction. The word and its train
of associated ideas evolved in significant fashion
from her mental topsy-turvy. Dinner!
With a strange man in a public place! The
prosaic word took new and curious meanings
unwritten upon the lexicon of her code. There
was the tangible presentation of her sin&mdash;that
she might read and run while there was yet
time. How had it all happened? What had
this insolent person said to make it possible
for her to forget herself for so long?</p>

<p>With no word of explanation her small feet
went hurrying down the hill while his big
ones strode protestingly alongside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said at last.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>But she gave him no answer and only
walked the faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Home&mdash;at once.&rdquo; She spoke with cold incisiveness.</p>

<p>He walked along a few moments in silence&mdash;then
said assertively:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For reply she only shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid.
A moment ago, you were willing to forget we
had just met. Now in a breath you&rsquo;re willing
to forget that we&rsquo;ve met at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she would not answer.</p>

<p>He glanced at the poise of the haughty
head just below his own. Was it mock virtue?
He felt thoroughly justified in believing
it so.</p>

<p>They had reached a corner. Patricia
stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll let me go here, won&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;ll
not follow me or try to find out anything, will
you? Say you won&rsquo;t, please, please! It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
all been a dreadful mistake&mdash;how dreadful
I didn&rsquo;t know until&mdash;until just now. I must
go&mdash;alone, you understand&mdash;alone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is getting dark, you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no! It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;m not
afraid. How can I be&mdash;now? Please let me
go&mdash;alone. Good-by!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in a moment she had vanished in the
cross street.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p class="cap">Mortimer Crabb watched the retreating figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H-m,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Eternal
Question&mdash;as usual&mdash;without the answer. And
yet I would have sworn that that parasol in
the Square&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had always possessed an attitude of
amused and tolerant patronage for the City
of Brotherly Love&mdash;it was the birthright of
any typical New Yorker&mdash;and yet since that
inconsiderable adventure in Rittenhouse
Square, he had discovered undreamed-of virtues
in the Pennsylvania metropolis. It was a
city not of apartments, but of homes&mdash;homes
in which men lived with their families and
brought up interesting children in the old-fashioned
way&mdash;a city of conservative progress,
of historic association, of well-guarded
tradition&mdash;an American city, in short&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
New York was not. At the Bachelors&rsquo; Club
he sang its praises, and mentioned a plan of
wintering there, but was laughed at for his
pains. Anything unusual and extraordinary
was to be expected of Mortimer Crabb. But
a winter in Philadelphia! This was too preposterous.</p>

<p>Crabb said nothing in reply. He only
smiled politely and when the <i>Blue Wing</i> was
put in commission went off on a cruise with
no other company but his thoughts and Captain
Jepson. Jepson under ordinary circumstances
would have been sufficient, but now
Mortimer Crabb spent much time in a deck
chair reading in a book of poems, or idly gazing
at the swirl of foam in the vessel&rsquo;s wake.
Jepson wondered what he was thinking of,
for Crabb was not a man to spend much time
in dreaming, and the Captain would have
given much that he possessed to know. He
would have been surprised if Mortimer Crabb
had told him. To tell the truth Crabb was
thinking&mdash;of a parasol. He was wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
if after all, his judgment had been erring.
The lady in the Square had left the parasol,
it was true. But then all the tribe of parasols
and umbrellas seemed born to the fate of
being neglected and forgotten, and there was
no reason why this particular specimen of
the genus should be exempt from the frailties
of its kind. As he remembered, it was
a flimsy thing of green silk and lace, obviously
a French frippery which might be
readily guilty of such a form of naughtiness.</p>

<p>It had long worried him to think that he
might have misjudged the sleeping princess&mdash;as
he had learned to call her&mdash;and he knew
that it would continue to worry him until he
proved the matter one way or another for
himself. Had she really forgotten the parasol?
Or had she&mdash;not forgotten it?</p>

<p>The cruise ended, the summer lengthened
into fall, and winter found Mortimer Crabb
established in residence at a fashionable hotel
in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Letters had come from New York to certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Philadelphia dowagers in the councils of
the mighty, to the end that in due course
Crabb accepted for several desirable dinners,
and before he knew he found himself in the
full swing of a social season. And so when
the night of the Assembly came around, he
found himself dining at the house of one of
his sponsors in a party wholly given over to
the magnification of three tremulous young female
persons, who were to receive their <i>cachet</i>
and certificate of eligibility in attending that
ancient and honorable function.</p>

<p>It was just at the top of the steps leading
to the foyer of the ball-room that Crabb met
Patricia Wharton in the crowd, face to face.
The encounter was unavoidable. He saw
the brief question in her glance before she
placed him, the vanishing smile, the momentary
pallor, and then was conscious that she
had gone by, her eyes looking past him, her
brows slightly raised, her lips drawn together,
the very letter of indifference and contempt.
It was cutting advanced to the dignity of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
fine art. Crabb felt the color rise to his temples
and heard the young bud at his side
saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Mr. Crabb? You look as if
you&rsquo;d seen the ghost of all your past transgressions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>All</i> of them, Miss Cheston! Oh, I hope
I don&rsquo;t look as bad as that,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Only
one&mdash;a very tiny one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do tell me,&rdquo; cried the bud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, let&rsquo;s safely run the gantlet of the
lorgnons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the party was assembled and past the
grenadiers who jealously guard the sacred
inner bulwarks, Crabb was glad to relinquish
his companion to another, while he sought seclusion
behind a bank of azaleas to watch the
moving dancers. So she really <i>was</i> somebody.
He began, for a moment, to doubt the testimony
of the vagrant glances and the guilty
parasol. Could he have been mistaken? Had
she really forgotten the parasol after all? The
situation was brutal enough for her and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
was quite prepared to respect her delicacy.
What he did resent was the way in which she
had done it. She had taken to cover angrily
and stood at bay with all her woman&rsquo;s weapons
sharpened. The curl of lip and narrowed
eye bespoke a degree of disdain quite out of
proportion to the offense. But he made a
rapid resolution not to seek her or meet her
eye. If his was the fault, it was the only reparation
he could offer her.</p>

<p>As he whirled around the room with his
little bud, he caught a glimpse of her upon
the opposite side and so maneuvered that he
would come no nearer. When he had guided
his partner to a seat, it did not take him long
to gratify a very natural curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;who&mdash;no,
don&rsquo;t look now&mdash;the girl in the black
spangly dress is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who? Where?&rdquo; asked Miss Cheston.
&ldquo;Patricia, you mean? Of course! Miss
Wharton, my cousin. Haven&rsquo;t you met her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;no! She&rsquo;s good-looking.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she? And the dearest creature&mdash;but
rather cold and the least bit prim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pri&mdash;Oh, really!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! We&rsquo;re Quakers, you know. She belongs
to the older set. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why she
seems a trifle cold and&mdash;er&mdash;conventional.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Convent&mdash;! Oh, yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know we&rsquo;re really quite a breezy lot,
if you only know us. Some of this year&rsquo;s debs
are really very dreadful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How shocking, and Miss Wharton is not
dreadful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no. But she is awfully good fun.
Come, you must meet her. Let me take you
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But good fortune in the person of Stephen
Ventnor intervened.</p>

<p>It was the unexpected which was to happen.
Crabb was returning from the table
with a favor. His eye ran along the line of
chairs in a brief fruitless search. Mr. Barclay,
who was leading the cotillion, caught
his eye at this precise psychological moment.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Stranded, Crabb? Let me present you
to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He mentioned no name but was off in a
moment winding in and out among those on
the floor. Crabb followed. When he had
succeeded in eluding the imminent dancers
and had reached the other side of the room,
there was Barclay bending over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Awfully nice chap&mdash;stranger,&rdquo; he was
saying, and then aloud, &ldquo;Miss Wharton, may
I present&mdash;Mr. Crabb?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was all over in a moment. The crowded
room had hidden the black dress and the fair
hair. But it was too late. Barclay was off
in a second and there they were looking again
into each other&rsquo;s eyes, Patricia pale and cold
as stone, Crabb a trifle ill at ease at the awkward
situation which, however appearances
were against him, was none of his choosing.</p>

<p>Crabb inclined his head and extended the
hand which carried his favor. They both
glanced down, seeking in that innocent trinket
a momentary refuge from the predicament.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
It was then for the first time that Crabb discovered
the thing he was offering her&mdash;a little
frivolous green silk parasol.</p>

<p>She looked up at him again, her eyes blazing,
but she rose to her feet and looked around
her as though seeking some mode of escape.
He fully expected that she would refuse to
dance, and was preparing to withdraw as
gracefully as he might when, with chin erect
and eyes which looked and carried her spirit
quite beyond him, she took the parasol and
followed him upon the floor.</p>

<p>But the subtlety of suggestion which seemed
to possess Crabb&rsquo;s particular little comedy
was to be still more amusingly developed.
The figure in which they became a part was
a pretty vari-colored whirl of flowers and
ribbons, in which the green parasols were
destined to play a part. For a miniature
Maypole was brought and the parasols were
fastened to the depending ribbons in accordance
with their color.</p>

<p>As the figure progressed and the dancers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
interwove, Crabb could not fail to note the
recurrent intentional snub. He felt himself
blameless in the unlucky situation, and this
needless display of hostility so clearly expressed
seemed made in very bad taste. Each
time he passed the flaunted shoulder, the upcast
chin, or curling lip, he found his humility
to be growing less and less until as the dance
neared its end he glowed with a very righteous
ire. If she had meant to deny him completely,
she should have chosen the opportunity
when he had first come up. And as he
passed her, he rejoiced in the discovery that
she had inadvertently chosen the other end of
the ribbon attached to the very parasol which
he bore. When the May dance was over,
Miss Wharton found Mr. Crabb at her side
handing her the green parasol precisely as
he had handed her that other one in the
Square six months before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; he was saying quizzically,
&ldquo;but isn&rsquo;t this yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The accent and benevolent eye were unmistakable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
If there were any arrow in her
quiver of scorn unshot, his effrontery completely
disarmed her. If looks could have
killed, Crabb must have died at once. Assured
of the depths of his infamy, she could
only murmur rather faintly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall go to my seat, at once, please.&rdquo; Indeed,
Crabb was a very lively corpse. He
was smiling coolly down at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if you wish it. Only&mdash;er&mdash;I
hope you&rsquo;ll let me go along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How she hated him! The words uttered
again with the same smiling effrontery seemed
to be burned anew into her memory. Could
she never be free from this inevitable man?
Her seat was at the far end of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you have done me some injustice,&rdquo;
he said quietly, and then, &ldquo;It has been a pleasant
dance. Thank you so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Patricia acidly, and
he was gone.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p class="cap">Miss Wharton rather crossly dismissed
her weary maid, and threw
herself into an armchair. Odious
situation! Her peccadillo had found her out!
What made the matter still worse was the ingenuous
impeccability of her villain. On
every hand she heard his praises sung. And
it vexed her that she had been unable to contribute
anything to his detriment. Of course,
after seeing her leave the parasol it would
have been stupid of him to&mdash;to let her forget
it. In her thoughts that adventure had long
since been condoned. It was this new <i>rencontre</i>
which had so upset her. It angered
her to think how little delicacy he gave her
credit for when he had asked Jack Barclay
to present him. If they had met by chance,
it would have been different. She would have
been sharply civil, but not retrospective; and<span class="ispan pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
would have trusted to his sense of the situation
to be the same. That he had assailed
her helpless barriers, wrote him down a brute,
divested him of all the garments of sensibility
in which she had clothed him. It angered
her to think that her fancy had seen fit to
make him any other than he was. But mingled
with her anger, she was surprised to discover
disappointment, too. It was this&mdash;this
person who shared with her the secret of her
one iniquity.</p>

<p>She pulled impatiently at her long gloves
and arose with an air of finality. And so
Miss Wharton put the importunate Mr.
Crabb entirely from her mind; until the following
Thursday night at the dinner at the
Hollingsworths&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patty, dear, have you met Mr. Crabb?&rdquo;
Mrs. Hollingsworth was saying.</p>

<p>Miss Wharton had, at the Assembly.</p>

<p>Mr. Crabb politely echoed; and Patricia
hated him for the nebulous smile which
seemed to contain hidden meanings. But she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
rose to the occasion in a way which seemed
to disconcert her companion&mdash;who only answered
her rapid fire of commonplaces in
monosyllables. At the table she found her
refuge upon the other side to be an Italian
from the embassy at Washington, whose
French limped but whose English was a cripple.
And so they minced and stuttered, Ollendorf
fashion, through the oysters and soup,
while Crabb occupied himself with the
daughter of the house upon his other side.
But at last Patty was aware that Mr. Crabb
was speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Wharton,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I fear I&rsquo;ve
been put somewhat under a cloud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she answered sweetly, &ldquo;how so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little disconcerted but undismayed, he
continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because of the manner of our meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our meeting!&rdquo; she said uncertainly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the Assembly, you know. I thought
perhaps that&mdash;you thought&mdash;I&rsquo;d asked to be
presented.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you? Then, how did we happen
to meet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could not but admire her <i>sang-froid</i>.
She was smiling a non-committal smile at the
centerpiece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;I should explain. I was adrift and
Barclay came to my rescue. I give you my
word, I had no notion it was to you he was
taking me. It was all over in a second.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you really didn&rsquo;t wish to meet me?
I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had turned her face slowly to his and
was looking him levelly in the eyes. It was
a challenge, not a petition. He met her thrust
fairly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Wharton,&rdquo; he smiled,
&ldquo;how could I know what you were like&mdash;er&mdash;if
I&rsquo;d never seen you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time he fairly set her weapon flying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I wish you to understand,&rdquo; he continued,
steadily, &ldquo;is that I didn&rsquo;t know that
Barclay was taking me to you. I wish credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
for a certain delicacy. I should not have
cared to force myself upon you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I shouldn&rsquo;t have minded in the
least,&rdquo; she said, lightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so difficult
as all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as she had spoken she knew she had
overshot her mark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s awfully good of you, you know.
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll admit I had no means of knowing,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;how difficult you were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flushed a little before returning to the
attack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course a girl wishes to know a little
something about a man before&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before she permits herself to misjudge
him.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;Candidly, do you feel
in any better position to judge me now than
you did before&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before the Assembly?&rdquo; she interrupted.
&ldquo;I think so. You don&rsquo;t eat with your knife,&rdquo;
laughing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a respect for the napkin.
People say you&rsquo;re clever. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I
believe them?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If this is your creed of morality, I&rsquo;m respectability
itself. Can you doubt me? Why
won&rsquo;t you be frank? If I&rsquo;m respectable why
shouldn&rsquo;t you have cared to meet me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I thought very much about it.
How did you know I didn&rsquo;t wish to meet
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could I know you did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up at him, a new expression on
her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;abhorred
the very thought of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb looked contemplatively at his truffle.
&ldquo;I thank you for your candor,&rdquo; he replied at
last.</p>

<p>Then after a pause, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll forgive me,
I&rsquo;ll promise not to mention the subject again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I don&rsquo;t forgive you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re at my mercy for this hour at least,&rdquo;
he laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can still fly to Italy,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I
could forgive you, I think, but for one thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked the question.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This dinner. Is it to chance that I&rsquo;m indebted
for the&mdash;the&mdash;honor of your society?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb&rsquo;s gaze had dropped to the table, but
she had seen just such a sparkle in them once
before. Nor when he looked at her had it
disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She continued gazing at him steadily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;did I arrange it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Patricia bowed her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could I have done so?&rdquo; he urged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Nick Hollingsworth an intimate
friend of yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I fail to see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you deny it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to take me a little
on faith,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;At any rate you
will not suffer long. I&rsquo;m leaving town in a
few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For long?&rdquo; she asked politely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For good, I think. Won&rsquo;t you let me come
in to see you before then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mrs. Hollingsworth had cast her
glance down the line and drawn back her
chair.</p>

<p>When the men came down into the drawing
room, Mr. Crabb discovered that Miss
Wharton had carefully ensconced herself in
the center of a perimeter of skirts, which defied
disintegration and apportionment. There
was music and afterwards a call for carriages.
So Mr. Crabb saw no more of Miss Wharton
upon that night. Nor, indeed, did Patricia
see him again. The following day he called.
She was out. Then came a note and some
roses. Business had called him sooner than
he had expected. He begged to assure her of
his distinguished consideration; would she
forgive him now that he was gone, accept this
new impertinence and forget all those that
had gone before?</p>

<p>Patricia accepted the impertinence; and
for many days it filled her little white room
with seductive odors that made his last admonition
more difficult.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p class="cap">The months of winter passed and
Crabb returned not. July found
the Whartons again at Bar Harbor.
Patricia would go out for hours in her canoe
or her sailboat, rejoicing with bronzed cheek
and hardening muscles in the buffets and caresses
of Frenchman&rsquo;s Bay. It was a very tiny
catboat that she had learned to manage herself
and in which she would tolerate no male
hand at the helm except in the stiffest blows.</p>

<p>One quiet afternoon, early in August, she
was sailing alone down toward Sorrento. It
was one of those brilliant New England days
when every detail of water and sky shone
clear as an amethyst. Here and there a sail
cut a sharp yellow rhomboid from the velvet
woods. Patricia listened idly to the lapping
of the tiny waves and found herself thinking
again rather uncomfortably of the one person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
who had caught her off her guard and kept
her there. If he had only stayed in Philadelphia
one week more, she could at least have
retired with drums beating and colors flying.</p>

<p>A sound distracted her. She looked to leeward
under the lifting sail and on her bow,
well out in the open off Stave Island, she
could make out the lines of an overturned
canoe and two figures in the water. She
quickly loosed the sheet and shifted her helm
and bore down rapidly upon the unfortunates.
She could see a man bearing upon one end of
the canoe lifting the other into the air, trying
to get the water out; but each time he did so,
a bull terrier dog swam to the gunwale and
overturned it again. She sped by to leeward
and, skilfully turning her little craft upon its
heel, came up into the wind alongside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; said the moistful person,
smiling.</p>

<p>The hair was streaked down into his eyes.
He hardly wondered that she didn&rsquo;t recognize
him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabb!&rdquo; she said at last, rather faintly,
&ldquo;how did you happen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the dog,&rdquo; he said cheerfully. &ldquo;I
thought he understood canoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might have drowned you. Why, it&rsquo;s
Jack Masters&rsquo; &lsquo;Teddy,&rsquo;&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Here,
Teddy, come aboard at once, sir.&rdquo; She bent
over the low freeboard and by dint of much
hauling managed to get him in.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the catboat had drifted
away from the canoe. Crabb had at last succeeded
in getting in and was now bailing with
his cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come over?&rdquo; shouted Patricia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;It was
the dog I was worried about.&rdquo; Then for the
first time he was aware that the paddle had
drifted off and was now floating a hundred
yards away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but my paddle is adrift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Patricia, amid much barking from the
rejuvenated Teddy, came alongside again.</p>

<p>There sat the bedraggled and dripping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Crabb in three inches of water, his empty
hands upon the gunwales, looking rather foolishly
up at the blue eyes that were smiling
rather whimsically down.</p>

<p>She could not resist the temptation to banter
him. Had she prayed for vengeance,
nothing could have been sent to her sweeter
than this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look rather&mdash;er&mdash;glum,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; he replied, calmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not
been so happy in months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth is there to prevent my sailing
off and leaving you?&rdquo; she laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right. I&rsquo;ll
swim for the paddle when I&rsquo;m rested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you thought I might take that with
me, too?&rdquo; she asked sweetly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he laughed, trying to suppress
the chattering teeth. &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;ll be along
presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure. You&rsquo;re really very
much at my mercy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were not always so unkind.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabb!&rdquo; Patricia retired in confusion
to the tiller. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re impudent!&rdquo; She hauled
in her sheet and the boat gathered headway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Miss Wharton, please!&rdquo; he
shouted. But Patricia did not move from the
tiller, and the catboat glided off. He watched
her sail down and recover the paddle and
then head back toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you forgive me and take me in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must. But I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d rather
you&rsquo;d drown. I&rsquo;m hardly in the mood for
coals of fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, though,&rdquo; he chattered, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m
d&mdash;deucedly c&mdash;cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t deserve it. But if you were
drowned I suppose I&rsquo;d be to blame. I
wouldn&rsquo;t have you on my conscience again for
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then please take me on your boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you behave yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And never again refer to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Um&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then please come in&mdash;out of the wet.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was toward the end of August when the
southeast wind had raised a gray and thunderous
sea, that two persons sat under the lee
of a rock near Great Head and watched the
giant breakers shatter themselves to foam.
They sat very close together, and the little
they said was drowned in the roar of the elements.
But they did not care. They were
willing just to sit and watch the fruitless
struggles of the swollen waters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me,&rdquo; said the girl at last,
&ldquo;about that dinner? Didn&rsquo;t you really ask
Mrs. Hollingsworth to send you in with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man looked amusedly off at the jagged
horizon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I really didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said, and then,
after a pause, with a laugh: &ldquo;but Nick did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whited sepulcher!&rdquo; said the girl. Another
pause. This time the man questioned:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is another thing&mdash;won&rsquo;t you tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
me? About the parasol last summer&mdash;did
you forget it, really&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;just leave it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mortimer!&rdquo; she cried, flushing furiously.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he assisted her in hiding her face, smiling
down benevolently the while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really? Honestly? Truly?&rdquo; he said,
softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t what?&rdquo; he still persevered.</p>

<p>She looked up at him for a moment, flushed
more furiously than before and sought refuge
anew. But the muffled reply was perfectly
distinguishable to the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;<i>didn&rsquo;t</i>&mdash;forget it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="#image01">But the Great Head rocks didn&rsquo;t hear.</a></p>

<p>Thus Mortimer Crabb, having spent much
of his time in making opportunities for other
people, had at last succeeded in making one
for himself.</p>

<p>He had the pleasure of knowing, too, that
he was also making one for Patty&mdash;not that
this was Miss Wharton&rsquo;s first opportunity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
for everyone knew that her rather sedate demeanor
concealed a capricious coquetry which
she could no more control than she could the
music of the spheres. But this was going to
be a different kind of opportunity, for Crabb
had decided that not only was she going to be
engaged to him, but that when the time came
she was going to marry him.</p>

<p>This decision reached, he spent all of his
time in convincing her that he was the one
man in the world exactly suited to her protean
moods. The sum of his possessions had
not been made known to her, and he delighted
in planning his surprise. So that when the
<i>Blue Wing</i> appeared in the harbor, he invited
her for a sail in her own catboat, calmly
took the helm in spite of her protests, and before
she was aware of it, had made a neat
landing at his own gangway. Jepson poked
his head over the side and welcomed them,
grinning broadly, and, following Crabb&rsquo;s inviting
gesture, Patricia went up on deck feeling
very much like the lady who had married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the Lord of Burleigh. Then Jepson gave
some mysterious orders and before long she
was reclining luxuriously in a deck chair and
the <i>Blue Wing</i> was breasting the surges which
showed the way to the open sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All of this,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Crabb gayly, with a
fine gesture which comprehended the whole
of the North Atlantic Ocean, &ldquo;&lsquo;is mine and
thine.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice of you to be so rich. Why
didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; said Patricia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I had a certain pride in wanting
you to like me for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think I would have married you for
your money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said, promptly, &ldquo;of course
you would. A rich man has about as much
chance of entering the Kingdom of Romance
as the Biblical camel has to get through the
eye of the needle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is it then that I find you so very
much more attractive now that I&rsquo;ve found the
<i>Blue Wing</i>?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But you found <i>me</i> first,&rdquo; he laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; archly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you still doubt it, there&rsquo;s the
parasol!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mention of the parasol always silenced
her.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p class="cap">That was one of many cruises,
and the <i>Blue Wing</i> contributed not
a little to the gayety of the waning
days of summer at Mount Desert. It was the
<i>Blue Wing</i>, too, that in early September
brought the Wharton family, bag and baggage,
southward to Philadelphia, where Mortimer
Crabb lingered, hoping to exact a promise
of marriage before Christmas. But Patricia
would make no promises. She had a
will of her own, her fiancé discovered, and
had no humor to forego the independence of
her spinsterhood for the responsibilities which
awaited her. It was in this situation that
Crabb discovered himself to be possessed of
surprising virtues in tolerance and tact. Patricia,
he knew, had many admirers. The
woods at Bar Harbor had been, both figuratively
and literally, filled with them, and<span class="ispan pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
most of them had been eligible. Jack Masters,
and Stephen Ventnor, who lived in Philadelphia,
were still warm in pursuit of the
fair quarry, who had not yet consented to an
announcement of her engagement to Crabb.</p>

<p>But these men caused him little anxiety.
They were both quite young and quite callow
and stood little chance with a cosmopolitan
of Crabb&rsquo;s caliber. But there was another
man of whom people spoke. His name was
Heywood Pennington, and for three years he
had been off a-soldiering in the Philippines.
It had only been a boy-and-girl affair, of
course, and most people in Philadelphia had
forgotten it, but from his well-stored memory
Crabb recalled at least one calf-love that
had later grown into a veritable bull-in-the-china-shop.
It was not that he didn&rsquo;t believe
fully that Patricia would marry him, and it
wasn&rsquo;t that he didn&rsquo;t believe in Patricia. It
was only that he knew that for the first time
in his life, his whole happiness depended upon
that least stable but most wonderful of creatures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the unconscious coquette. Moreover,
Mortimer Crabb believed firmly in himself,
and he also believed that, married to him,
Patricia would be safely fulfilling her manifest
destiny.</p>

<p>But the Philippine soldier kept bobbing up
into Crabb&rsquo;s background at the most inopportune
moments: once when the soldier&rsquo;s
name had been mentioned on the <i>Blue Wing</i>,
and Patricia had sighed and turned her gaze
to the horizon, again at a dinner at Bar Harbor,
and later in Philadelphia, at the Club.
Bit by bit Crabb had learned Heywood Pennington&rsquo;s
history, from the wild college days,
through his short business career to the tempestuous
and scarcely honorable adventures
which had led to his enlistment under a false
name in the regular army three years ago. It
was not a creditable history for a fellow of
Pennington&rsquo;s antecedents, and when his name
was mentioned, even the fellows who had
known him longest, turned aside and dismissed
him with a word.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The name of the soldier never passed between
the engaged couple, and so far as Crabb
was concerned, Mr. Pennington might never
have existed.</p>

<p>Patricia lacked nothing which the most exacting
fiancée might require. Roses and violets
arrived regularly at the Wharton country
place near Haverford, and in the afternoons
Crabb himself came in a motor car, always
cheerful, always patient, always original and
amusing.</p>

<p>To such a wooing, placid, and ardent by
turns, Patty yielded inevitably, and at last,
late in September, consented to announce the
engagement. The news was received in her
own family circle with delighted amazement,
for Mortimer Crabb had by this time made
many friends in Philadelphia, and Miss
Wharton had refused so many offers that her
people, remembering Pennington, had decided
that their handsome relative was destined
to a life of single blessedness. They
bestirred themselves at once in a round of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
entertainments in her honor, the first of which
was a lawn party and masque at her uncle
Philip Wharton&rsquo;s country place, near Bryn
Mawr.</p>

<p>Philip Wharton never did things by halves,
and society, back from the seashore and mountains,
welcomed the first large entertainment
which was to mark the beginning of the country
life between seasons.</p>

<p>The gay crowds swarmed out from the
wide doorways, into the balmy night, liberated
from the land of matter-of-fact into a domain
of enchantment. Gayly caparisoned
cavaliers, moving in the spirit of the characters
they represented strode gallantly in the
train of their ladies whose graceful draperies
floated like film from white shoulders and
caught in their silken meshes the shimmer of
the moonbeams. Bright eyes flashed from
slits in masks and bolder ones looked searchingly
into them. All of the ages had assembled
upon a common meeting ground; a cinquecento
rubbed elbows with an American Indian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Joan of Arc was cajoling a Crusader, a
nun was hazarding her hope of salvation in
flirtation with the devil, the eyes of a Puritan
maid fell before the glances of a matador.
Nothing had been spared in costume or
in setting to make the picture complete. The
music halted a moment and then swept into
the rhythm of a waltz. A murmur of delight
and like a change in the kaleidoscope the
pieces all converged upon the terrace.</p>

<p>It was here that a diversion occurred. A
laugh went up from a group upon the steps
and their glances were turned in one direction.
Seated upon the balustrade in the glow
of the Chinese lanterns sat a tramp, drinking
a glass of punch from the refreshment table
close at hand. It was a wonderful disguise
that he wore. The shirt of some dark material,
was stained and torn, the hat, of the
brown, army type, was battered out of shape,
and many holes had been bored into the
crown. The trousers had worn to the color
of dry grass and the boots were old, patched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and yellow with mud and grime. In place
of the conventional black mask, he wore a
bandanna handkerchief tied around his brow,
with holes for the eyes. The ends of the handkerchief
hung to his breast and hid his features,
but under its edges could be seen a
brown ear and a patchy beard. As the crowd
watched him he lifted his glass aloft solemnly
and made the motions of drinking their
health. There was a roar of applause. A
whimsical arrogance in the pose of the
squarely-made shoulders and the tilt of the
head gave an additional interest to the somber
figure. He looked like a drawing from
the pages of a comic weekly, but the ostentation
of his gesture gave him a dignity that
made the resemblance less assured. As the
people crowded around him and sought to
pierce his disguise, he got down from his
perch and strolled away into the shadows.
When the music stopped again he was surrounded
by a curious group, but he towered
in their center grotesque, and inscrutable. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
those who questioned him too closely he mumbled
at their meddling and told them to be off.
Then he tightened his belt and asked when
supper would be ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo; someone asked. He
glared at the questioner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of a tramp would I be if I
wasn&rsquo;t hungry?&rdquo; he growled, and those around
him laughed again. So they took him to a
table and fed him. He ate ravenously. They
got him something to drink and it seemed to
vanish down his throat without even touching
his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he splendid?&rdquo; said Patricia Wharton,
who, with Mortimer Crabb, had just
come up. &ldquo;But who&mdash;&mdash;? I can&rsquo;t think of
anyone, and yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tramp looked up at her suddenly and
dropped his fork upon the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Splendid</i>,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me. <i>Splendid.</i>
I sure glitter in this bunch, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something irresistibly comic in
the gesture with which he swept the group.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Patricia was still watching him&mdash;a puzzled
expression in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; she asked; but Crabb shook
his head. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t an idea&mdash;but he <i>is</i>
clever. And look at those boots&mdash;they&rsquo;re the
real thing. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to try to dance
in them, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tramp drained his glass&mdash;set it down
on the table and wiped his mouth on the back
of his hand&mdash;rose and disappeared between
the palms and hydrangeas into the darkness.</p>

<p>For a guest in good standing the tramp
then behaved strangely, for when he had
reached a sheltered spot, in the bushes at the
end of the English Garden, he sank at full
length upon the grass and buried his head in
his hands, groaning aloud. It was three years
since he had seen her&mdash;three years, and yet
she was just as he had seen her last. Time had
touched her lightly, only caressing her playfully,
rounding her features to matured
beauty, while he&mdash;&mdash; A vision of camps,
cities, skirmishes, orgies, came out of his mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in a disordered procession, all culminating in
the incident which had brought him to ruin.
Every detail of <i>that</i> at least was clear; the
sudden rage where the bonds of patience had
reached the snapping point&mdash;and then the
blow. The tramp laughed outright. He
could see now the smirk on the face of the
drunken lieutenant as he toppled over backward
and struck his head on the edge of the
mahogany table. After that&mdash;irons, the
court martial, the transport, Alcatraz, his
chance, the friendly plank, the swim for the
mainland, and freedom. He had never heard
whether the man lived or died. He didn&rsquo;t
much care. He got what was coming to him.</p>

<p>The tramp was a fugitive still. He had
walked since morning from Malvern station,
where he had been thrown off the freight
train on which he had worked a ride east from
Harrisburg. At Bryn Mawr he had begged
a meal&mdash;the irony of it had sunk into his soul&mdash;at
the back door of a country house at which
he had once been a welcome guest. A gossipy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
chauffeur had let him into his garage for
a rest and had given him a cigarette over
which he had learned the recent doings in
the neighborhood. The thought of venturing
into Philip Wharton&rsquo;s grounds that night had
entered his madcap brain while he lay in the
woods along the Gulf Road, trying to make
up his mind whether his tired feet would
carry him the twelve miles that remained between
him and the city.</p>

<p>Why had he returned? God knew. His
feet had dragged him onward as though impelled
by some force beyond his power to resist.
Now that he was near the home of his
boyhood it seemed as if any other place in the
world would have been better. It was so real&mdash;the
peaceful respectability of this country&mdash;so
like Her. And yet its very peacefulness
and respectability angered him. Was it nothing
to have hungered and thirsted and sweated
that the honor of these people and that of
others like them might be preserved? Even
Patricia&rsquo;s blamelessness was intolerant&mdash;reproachful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
The springs of memory that had
gushed forth just now at the sight of her
were dried in their source. There was a dull
ache, a sinking of the spirit that was almost
a physical pain; but the unreasoning fever of
the wayward boy, the wrenching fury of the
outcast soldier were lacking, and for a long
time he lay where he had fallen without
moving.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p class="cap">Patricia Wharton stood a moment
on the edge of the terrace after
the dance, slipped her hand into Mortimer
Crabb&rsquo;s arm and came down upon the
path, drawing a drapery across her white
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Crabb. &ldquo;You are not
cold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;I think I am a
little tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a beautiful
spot&mdash;just here.&rdquo; He led her across the lawn
and through an opening in the trees to a
garden-bench in the shadow, a spot which
none of the other maskers had discovered.
Through the leafy screen they could see the
gay figures floating like will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps
across the golden lawn, but here they were
quiet and unobserved. Patricia sank upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
bench with a sigh, while Crabb sat beside
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you happy?&rdquo; he asked after awhile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;What a
beautiful party!&rdquo; She placed her hand in his
and moved a little closer to him, then sat listlessly,
her eyes seeking the spaces between the
branches where the people were. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to grow old too soon,&rdquo; she was saying.
&ldquo;The whole world is in short clothes to-night.
Wouldn&rsquo;t it be good to be young forever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is good to be young.
But isn&rsquo;t it anything to take your place in the
world? I want you to know all a man can do
for the woman he loves. Won&rsquo;t you let me?
Soon?&rdquo; He bent over her and took the
rounded arm in his strong hand. She did not
withdraw it, but something told him a link of
sympathy was lacking in the chain. As she
did not reply he straightened and sat moodily
looking before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me capricious, please,&rdquo; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
began. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re everything I can hope for&mdash;and
yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>She paused a moment, then broke in, &ldquo;Forgive
me, won&rsquo;t you? I don&rsquo;t know what it is.
Something has affected me strangely.&rdquo; She
leaned against the back of the bench, rested
her head in her hand, away from him, and
Crabb turned jealously toward her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were thinking&mdash;of him&mdash;of the
other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be honest with you? I
can&rsquo;t help it. Something has suddenly
brought him into my mind. I was wondering&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was wondering where he is now&mdash;to-night.
It is so beautiful here. Everything
has been done to make us happy. I was thinking
that perhaps if I had written him a line
I might have saved him some terrible trial.
It was only a boy-and-girl affair, of course,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Patricia suddenly stopped speaking, and
both of them turned their heads toward the
dark bank of bushes behind them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dead branch falling,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>They listened again, but all they heard was
the sound of the orchestra and the voices of
the dancers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re teaching me a lesson in patience,&rdquo;
Crabb began again soberly. &ldquo;I can wait, of
course. I&rsquo;m not jealous of <i>him</i>,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
was only wondering how you could think of
him at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think of him&mdash;not in <i>that</i> way. I
believe I haven&rsquo;t thought of him at all&mdash;until
to-night. To-night, I can&rsquo;t help thinking of
others less fortunate than ourselves. I suppose
it&rsquo;s only the natural thing that he should suffer.
He never seemed to get things right,
somehow; his point of view was always askew.
He was a wild boy&mdash;but he was human.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused and clasped her hands before
her. Crabb sat silent beside her, but his brow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
was clouded. When he spoke it was in a
voice low and constrained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think it kind&mdash;wise to speak of
this now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking that perhaps if he&rsquo;d had
a little luck&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might have come back to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia turned toward him and with a swift
movement took one of his hands in both of
hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak in that way,&rdquo; she pleaded.
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But his fingers still refused to respond to
her pressure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I think of him at all, it is because I
have learned how great a thing is love and
how much the greater must be its loss. You
know,&rdquo; she whispered, timidly, &ldquo;you know I&mdash;I
love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you for that,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

<p>They were so absorbed that they did not
hear the sound behind them&mdash;a suppressed
moan like that of an animal in pain.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you forgive me?&rdquo; asked the girl, at
last. &ldquo;It is all over now. I shall never speak
of it again. I&rsquo;ve spoiled your evening. You
don&rsquo;t regret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb laughed happily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise to be good,&rdquo; she said, softly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do whatever you ask me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me next month?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;whenever you
wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took her in his arms and kissed her.
They stood for some time deaf to all voices
but those in their hearts. There was a breaking
of tiny twigs under the trees behind them
and a drab figure came out into the open on
the other side and vanished into the darkness
by the garden wall. And as they walked back
into the house neither guessed just what had
happened except that some new miracle,
which, really, is very old, had happened to
them.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, when Patricia announced
the miracle in the form of her engagement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to Mortimer Crabb a prayer of
thanksgiving went up from at least three
young women of her acquaintance. And
though these feminine petitioners were left as
much to their own devices as before the announcement,
there was a certain comfort in
knowing that she was out of the way&mdash;at
least, that she was as much out of the way as
it was possible for Patricia to be, bound or
untrammeled. Jack Masters went abroad,
Steve Ventnor actually went to work, and
various other swains sought pastures new.</p>

<p>Ross Burnett was best man and, when the
ceremony and breakfast were over, saw the
happy couple off upon the <i>Blue Wing</i>, for
their long Southern cruise. They offered
him conduct as far as Washington, whither he
was bound, but he knew from the look in their
eyes that he was not wanted, and with a
promise to meet them in New York when they
returned, he waved them a good-by from the
pier and took up the thread of his Government
business where it had been dropped. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
is not often that good comes out of villainy,
and the memory of the adventure in which
Crabb had involved him, often troubled his
conscience. What if some day he should meet
Baron Arnim or Baron Arnim&rsquo;s man and
be recognized? At the State Department
Crowthers had asked him no questions and
he had thought it wise not to offer explanations.
But certain it was that to that adventure
alone was his present prosperity directly
due. His South American mission successfully
concluded, he had returned to Washington
with the assurance that other and even
more important work awaited him. His
point of view had changed. All he had needed
was initiative, and, Crabb having supplied
that deficiency, he had learned to face the
world again with the squared shoulders of the
man who had at last found himself. The
world was his oyster and he would open it
how and when he liked.</p>

<p>It was this new attitude perhaps which enabled
him to take note of the taming of Mortimer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Crabb, for when he visited the bride
and groom in their sumptuous house in New
York, he discovered that Crabb had formed
the habit of the easy-chair after dinner, and
that the married life, which all his days he
had professed to abhor, was the life for him.
It took the combined efforts of Burnett and
Patricia to dislodge him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s absolutely impossible,&rdquo; said Patricia.
&ldquo;He says that he has solved the problem of
happiness&mdash;that he has done with the world.
It&rsquo;s so like a man,&rdquo; and she stamped her small
foot, &ldquo;to think that marriage is the end of
everything when&mdash;as everyone knows&mdash;it&rsquo;s
only the beginning. He&rsquo;s getting stout already,
and I know, I&rsquo;m positive that he is
going to be bald. Won&rsquo;t you help me, Mr.
Burnett?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dreadful prospect&mdash;Benedick, the
married man. You only need carpet slippers
and a cribbage-board, Mort, to make the picture
complete. Have you stopped seeking
opportunities?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; drawled Crabb, &ldquo;Patty is the
only opportunity I ever had&mdash;at least&mdash;er&mdash;the
only one worth embracing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mortimer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you ever go to the Club?&rdquo;
laughed Ross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. I&rsquo;m taboo there since I lived in
Philadelphia. Besides, I&rsquo;m not a bachelor
any more, you know. If Patty only wouldn&rsquo;t
insist on dragging me out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twice, Ross, already this winter,&rdquo; Crabb
continued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cruelty, nothing less.&rdquo; But
the perpetrator of the outrage was smiling,
and she leaned forward just then and laid her
hand in that of her husband, saying with a
laugh, &ldquo;Mort, you know we&rsquo;ll have to get
Ross married at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Burnett, in alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. A bachelor only sneers at a
Benedick when he has given up hoping&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say now&mdash;I&rsquo;m not so old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you do hope?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I only wait&mdash;for a miracle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the age of miracles,&rdquo; remarked
Patty thoughtfully, &ldquo;at least not miracles of
that kind. How can you expect anyone to
fall in love with you if you go on leaping from
one end of the earth to the other. No girl
wants to marry a kangaroo&mdash;even a diplomatic
kangaroo.&rdquo; She paused and examined him
with her head on one side. &ldquo;And yet you
know you&rsquo;re passably decent looking&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thanks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even distinguished&mdash;that foreign way of
wearing your mustache is really quite fetching.
You&rsquo;ll do, I think, with some coaching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you coach me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I object,&rdquo; interrupted Crabb, lazily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will. You&rsquo;re quite worth marrying&mdash;I&rsquo;m
at least sure you wouldn&rsquo;t condemn your
wife to her own lares and penates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I. She&rsquo;d get the wanderlust&mdash;or a
divorce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t boast, worse vagabonds than you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
have been tamed&mdash;come now, what shall she
be&mdash;blonde or brunette?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite
indifferent&mdash;pigment is cheap nowadays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re scoffing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ross Burnett leaned back in his chair and
smiled at the chandelier. Women had long
ago been omitted from his list of possibilities.
But Patricia was not to be denied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Married you shall be,&rdquo; she said with the
air of an oracle, &ldquo;and before the year is out.
I swear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why do you want me to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Revenge!&rdquo; she said tragically. &ldquo;You
helped marry me to Mort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the young matron was as good as her
word, though her method may have been unusual.</p>

<p>It came about in the following manner, and
Burnett&rsquo;s brother and Miss Millicent Darrow
were her unconscious agents. Miss
Darrow had gone to the Academy Exhibit.
The rooms were comfortably crowded. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
entered conscious of a certain dignity and repose
in the character of her surroundings.
She brought forth her catalogue, resolutely
opened it to the first page and in a moment was
oblivious to the people about her. She did
not belong to the great army &ldquo;who know what
they like.&rdquo; She had an instinctive perception
of the good, and found herself not a little
amazed at the amount of masterly work by
younger men whose names she had never
heard. It was an unpleasant commentary
upon the mentality and taste of the set in
which she moved, and she was conscious of a
sense of guilt; for was she not a reflection of
the shortcomings of those she was so ready
to condemn? &ldquo;The Plain&mdash;Evening&mdash;William
Hazelton&rdquo;&mdash;a direct rendering of an upland
field at dusk, between portraits by well-known
men; &ldquo;Sylvia&mdash;Henry Marlow&rdquo;&mdash;a
girl in a green bodice painted with knowledge
and assurance.</p>

<p>In another room were the things in a higher
key&mdash;she knew them at a glance; and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the opposite wall a full-length portrait that
looked like a Sargent. She was puzzled at
the color, which was different from that of
any man she remembered. The Sargents she
knew were grouped in another room&mdash;and yet
there was here the force and breadth of the
master. She experienced the same perplexity&mdash;&ldquo;Agatha&mdash;Philip
Burnett,&rdquo; said the catalogue.
She sank upon a bench before it and
gave herself up to quiet rapture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were a man,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;that
is how I should wish to paint, the drawing of
Sargent, the poetry of Whistler, the grace of
Alexander, the color of Benson. Philip Burnett,&rdquo;
she apostrophized, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Philistine.
Forgive me.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p class="cap">It was very pleasant under the subdued
lights from above. She followed the
sweep of the drapery with delighted eye,
taking an almost sensuous pleasure in the relation
of color and the grace of the arms and
throat&mdash;the simplicity of the modeling and
the admirable characterization.</p>

<p>She found herself repeating:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;And those that were good shall be happy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They shall sit in a golden chair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shall splash at a ten-league canvas<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With brushes of comet&rsquo;s hair.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Philip Burnett, I wonder if you&rsquo;re good?
You ought to be. I&rsquo;d be good if I could
paint like that. I&rsquo;d work for an age at a
sitting, too. How could one ever be tired
making adagios in color? Oh!&rdquo; she sighed,
&ldquo;how good it must be to amount to something!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>A procession of agreeable, vacuous faces
passed before the canvas, creatures of a common
fate, garbed in the uniform of convention,
carrying the polite weapons of Vanity
Fair, each like the others and as uninteresting.
The few who wore the bright chevrons of distinction
had marched with the throng for a
time, but had gone back to their own. She
wondered if it would really matter if she
never saw them again; of course, the women&mdash;but
the men. Would she care?</p>

<p>Was there not another life? It beckoned
to her. What was Philip Burnett like?
Could he be young and handsome as well as
gifted? The vacuous faces vanished and in
their place she could see this young genius&mdash;Antinous
and Hercules combined&mdash;standing
before this canvas living for the mere joy of
work. Here was her answer. Was she to
flit through enchanted gardens other people
had planted, sipping only at the perfumed
petals while the honey to be garnered was in
plain sight?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>A voice broke in just beside her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s convincing, but I tell you, Burnett,
the arm&rsquo;s too long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. Not bad, though, for a new
man. You know we Burnetts are an exceptional
race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men moved away and the other&rsquo;s reply
was lost in the murmur of the crowd. Miss
Darrow turned to follow them with her eyes&mdash;what
a big fellow he was! with an admirable
profile, a straight nose, a waxed mustache,
and a chin like the one on the mask of
Brutus. Conceited, of course! All artists
were conceited. And who was that with him&mdash;Mortimer
Crabb? Yes, and there was the
bride talking to the Pendergasts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Milly, dear!&rdquo; Mrs. Pendergast
passed an incurious but observant eye over
her acquaintance. &ldquo;I thought you were in
Aiken. What a lovely hat! Are you going to
the Inghams? What will you wear? Isn&rsquo;t
it restful here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Darrow politely acquiesced and attempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
replies, but her eyes strayed toward
the Burnett portrait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stunning,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Pendergast.
&ldquo;A new man just over. Quite too clever.
Wonderful color, isn&rsquo;t it? Like a ripe pomegranate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you met him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. He belongs to the Westchester Burnetts,
though. Mrs. Hopkinson. So glad. Is
Frederick here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The agreeable lady had made of the portion
of the galleries in the neighborhood of
the Burnett portrait a semblance of her own
busy drawing-room. Other acquaintances
came up and Miss Darrow was soon lost in
the maze of small talk. A broad pair of
shoulders were thrust forward into her group,
and Miss Darrow found herself looking into
a pair of quizzical gray eyes which were
beaming a rather frank admiration into hers.
&ldquo;Miss Darrow&mdash;Mr. Burnett,&rdquo; Patricia
Crabb was saying; and Millicent Darrow was
conscious that in a moment the new arrival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
had quietly and cleverly appropriated her
and was taking her to the opposite side of
the room where he found for her a Winslow
Homer of rocks and stormy splendor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is it,&rdquo; she asked, after her first enthusiasm,
&ldquo;that the work of the artist so seldom
suggests its creator&rsquo;s personality?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The perversity of the human animal,&rdquo; he
laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the system of justice of the
great Republic of Art, Miss Darrow. If we
lose a characteristic here, we gain it somewhere
else. Rather a nice balance, don&rsquo;t you
think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hardly look the poet, Mr. Burnett&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t mind my saying so?&rdquo; she laughed.
&ldquo;And if you do dream, you do it with your
eyes very wide open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Burnett&rsquo;s brows were tangled in bewilderment.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really not much given to
dreaming. I&rsquo;m rather busy, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s splendid of you. You&rsquo;ve worked
long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;yes&mdash;since I left college,&rdquo; he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the tangle in his brows suddenly unraveling.
A smile now illuminated his rather whimsical
eyes. Miss Darrow found herself laughing
frankly into them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Art is long&mdash;you must be at least&mdash;thirty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Less,&rdquo; he corrected. &ldquo;Youth is my compensation
for not being a lawyer&mdash;or a
broker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was conscious of the personal note in
their conversation, but she made no effort to
avoid it. This genius of less than thirty
gave every token of sanity and good fellowship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Agatha?&rdquo; she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;er&mdash;a friend of mine in Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, in confusion.</p>

<p>And then:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The face is of the East&mdash;the Slav&mdash;did
you choose her for that character?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all. She was&mdash;er&mdash;just&mdash;just a sitter&mdash;a
commission, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How interesting!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>They had made the rounds of the room and
were now facing the portrait again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was lucky to have so good a model,&rdquo; he
continued. &ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t always. Have you
ever posed, Miss Darrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? No, never. Father has been trying to
get me painted this winter. But I&rsquo;ve been so
busy&mdash;and then we&rsquo;re going South in two
weeks&mdash;so we haven&rsquo;t been able to manage
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; The subtle sparkle had
died in his eyes, which from the shadow of
their heavy lashes were regarding hers intently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind. Would you really like
to paint me?&rdquo; said Miss Darrow. &ldquo;Suppose
I said you should. I want my portrait done.
If you make me half as wonderful as Agatha,
I shall die happy. Won&rsquo;t you come in to-morrow
at five? We can talk it over. I must
be going now. No, not now, to-morrow. Au
revoir.&rdquo; She gave him her hand with a
friendly nod, and threaded her way through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the crowd, leaving Burnett staring at the card
she had left in his hand.</p>

<p>On the way up-town in the machine Patricia
examined him, smiling curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a delusion you are, Ross Burnett!
Railing in one moment at matrimony and in
the next, tagging around like a tame bear at
the heels of the first pretty girl that crosses
your path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She <i>is</i> pretty, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; he admitted,
promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And quite the rage&mdash;this is her third season
you know. You seemed to be getting on
very rapidly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was all a mistake,&rdquo; Burnett laughed.
&ldquo;She thought I was an artist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An artist? What in the world&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do her portrait&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; Patricia leaned forward eagerly.
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;m brother Philip&mdash;the chap that
did the Agatha. She mistook me for him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and she was so nice about it that I didn&rsquo;t like
to interfere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb was lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, my dear Ross, that the East
has sapped some of your moral fiber,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly delightful,&rdquo; laughed Patricia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Ross can&rsquo;t paint&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try,&rdquo; said Burnett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia said no more, but all the way home
her face wore a smile which would not come
off. The miracle had happened. Had she
searched New York she could not have found
a girl more eminently suited to Ross Burnett.
That night Mortimer had some writing to
do, but Patricia and her guest sat for a long
while talking earnestly in the library. They
didn&rsquo;t take Mortimer into their confidence,
for Patricia had now gleefully donned the
mantle her husband had so carelessly thrown
aside. Here was an opportunity to make, and
Patricia became the goddess in the machine.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p class="cap">Several days passed. Ross Burnett
moved about the studio adjusting a
canvas upon an easel, bringing out
draperies, raising and lowering curtains, and
peering into drawers and chests in a manner
which betrayed an uncertain state of mind.
At last he seemed to find what he was looking
for&mdash;a drapery of soft gray material. This
he cast over the back of the easel, walked
back from it to the far side of the room where
he put his head on one side and looked with
half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>There was a clatter of the old French
knocker. Burnett dropped his paint tubes
and cigarette and opened the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I late?&rdquo; laughed Miss Darrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t come too early,&rdquo; said Burnett.
But he dubiously eyed the French maid
who had entered bearing a huge portmanteau.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I was so afraid to keep you waiting. You&rsquo;re
not very angry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve been here since dawn,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s not waste any time. Oh, isn&rsquo;t
it charming! Where shall I go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pushed open the door of the dressing
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll find the mirror fair,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How exciting! No. And I&rsquo;ll be out in
a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the door was closed Burnett eyed
the model-throne, the draperies, the chair,
and the canvas, seeking a last inspiration before
the imminent moment. He put a Japanese
screen behind the chair and threw a scarlet
drapery over one end of it, knocking at the
rebellious folds to make them fall as he
wished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will I do?&rdquo; asked the girl, radiantly
emerging. She wore a black evening dress.
The maid had thrown a filmy drapery over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
her which brought out the dull whiteness of
the shoulders. &ldquo;It is so different in the daytime,&rdquo;
she said, coloring; &ldquo;but father has always
wanted it so. You know I haven&rsquo;t told
him. It&rsquo;s to be a surprise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett&rsquo;s color responded to hers. He
bowed his head. &ldquo;You are charming,&rdquo; he
murmured gallantly with a seriousness she
could not fail to notice.</p>

<p>When Julie was dismissed to return at
luncheon-time, Mr. Burnett conducted Miss
Darrow to her throne and took his place before
the canvas. She stood leaning easily upon
the back of the chair, the lines of her slender
figure sweeping down from the radiant
head and shoulders into the dusky shadows
behind her. She watched him curiously as
he stood away from the easel to study the
pose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I only could&mdash;it&rsquo;s splendid so,&rdquo; he was
murmuring, &ldquo;but I wish you to sit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She acquiesced without question. &ldquo;I feel
like a specimen,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
ordeal. I&rsquo;m all arms and hands. <i>Must</i> you
squint?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Burnett&rsquo;s laugh all restraint was liberated
to the winds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. All artists squint. It&rsquo;s like the
circular sweep of the thumb&mdash;a symbol of the
craft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked behind her and adjusted the
screen, taking away the crimson drapery
and putting a greyish-green one in its
place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;just as you are. It&rsquo;s
stunning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was leaning forward with an elbow
on the chair arm, her hands clasped, one
slender wrist at her chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really! You&rsquo;re awfully easy to please&mdash;I
wonder if I shall do as well as Agatha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took up a charcoal&mdash;looked at its end,
and made a slight adjustment of the easel.
&ldquo;Before we begin&mdash;there&rsquo;s one thing I forgot.&rdquo;
He paused. &ldquo;All painters are sensitive,
you know. I&rsquo;m rather queerer than most. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
hope you won&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; The charcoal was now
making rapid gyrations upon the surface of
the canvas. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sensitive to criticism&mdash;in
the early stages. I usually manage
to pull out somehow&mdash;but in the beginning&mdash;when
I&rsquo;m drawing, laying in the figure&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t like my canvas seen. Sometimes it lasts
even longer. You won&rsquo;t mind not looking,
will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. That&rsquo;s what the grey thing is for.
I don&rsquo;t mind in the least; only I hope it will
come soon. I&rsquo;m wild to see. And please
smoke. I know you want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grateful Burnett drew forth his cigarette-case
and while his model rested busied
himself among his tubes of paint, squeezing
the colors out upon the palette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you only knew,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;how very
difficult it seems.&rdquo; But the large brush dipped
into the paint and Burnett worked vigorously,
a fine light glowing in his eyes. Miss Darrow
watched the generous flow from the oil cup
mingling with the colors.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<a href="#image03">What a lot of vermilion you use!</a>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 387px;">

<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;<a href="#Page_143">What a lot of vermilion you use.</a>&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Hair,&rdquo; he replied. He seemed so absorbed
that she said no more, and she didn&rsquo;t know
whether to laugh or frown. Later she ventured:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s carroty I&rsquo;ll never speak to you again.
Please make it auburn, Mr. Burnett.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He only worked the more rapidly. He
seemed to be dipping into every color upon
the palette, in the center of which had grown
a brown of the color of walnut-juice. This
he was applying vigorously to the lower part
of the canvas. When the palette was cleared
he put it aside and sank back in a chair with
a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rest,&rdquo; said the artist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the least tired,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But <i>I</i> am. It takes it out of me to be so
interested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it?&rdquo; She leaned back in her chair,
regarding him with a new curiosity. &ldquo;Do you
know,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;you are full of surprises&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>She ignored the inquiry of his upraised
brows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and paint,&rdquo; she finished with a laugh.</p>

<p>He ruefully eyed a discolored thumb. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
awfully untidy, I know. I&rsquo;ve always been.
In Paris they called me Slovenly Peter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t say that&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she indicated several streaks
of black on his grey walking-suit. &ldquo;Must one
always pay such a price to inspiration?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jove! That <i>was</i> stupid. I always do,
though, Miss Darrow.&rdquo; He examined the
spots and touched them with the tips of his
fingers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s paint,&rdquo; he finished, examining
it with a placidity almost impersonal. &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t matter in the least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you always smudge your face?&rdquo;
she asked sweetly. He looked at himself in
the mirror. There was a broad streak of red
across his forehead. He wiped it off with a
handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t laugh.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>He sank upon the edge of the throne, and
then they both laughed joyously, naturally,
like two children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an awfully lucky fellow,&rdquo; he said, at
last. &ldquo;I feel like a feudal baron with a captured
princess. Here are you, that most inaccessible
of persons, the Woman of Society,
doomed every morning for two weeks to play
Darby and Joan with a man you&rsquo;ve known
only three days. How on earth can a fellow
survive seeing a girl he likes behind cups of
tea! It&rsquo;s rough, I think. Society seems to accomplish
every purpose but its avowed one.
Instead of which everybody plays puss-in-the-corner.
A fellow might have a chance if the
corners weren&rsquo;t so far apart. And I, just back
from abroad with all the skeins of old friendship
at a loose end, walk into your circle and
quietly appropriate you for a fortnight&mdash;while
your other friends go a-begging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t begged very hard,&rdquo; she
laughed. &ldquo;If they had, perhaps they might
be playing Darby and Joan, too. I&rsquo;ve never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
tried it before. But I think it&rsquo;s rather
nice&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I&rsquo;ve rested <i>quite</i> twenty
minutes,&rdquo; she said after a moment. &ldquo;Come,
time is precious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She waited a moment for him to finish, but
he said no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How extraordinary!&rdquo; she said with a
pretty <i>mouë</i>. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I should
be pleased or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you blame me? The Forelock of
Time hangs too temptingly,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Of
course, if you&rsquo;d rather pose&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He took
up his dripping brushes with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed, I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she sank back
in the chair. &ldquo;Only don&rsquo;t you think&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
that really what I&rsquo;m here for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time to pose, Miss Darrow,&rdquo; he said
determinately.</p>

<p>But she made no move to get into the position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t complained,&rdquo; and she smiled at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
him. &ldquo;Your muse is difficult, and I&rsquo;m the
gainer. Really, I think I&rsquo;d rather talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m waiting to go on with the portrait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pose again on one condition&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you put on overalls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brushes and palette dropped to his side.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rough on Slovenly Peter,&rdquo; he
laughed. He set about squeezing the paint
tubes, wiping the brush handles and edge of
the palette. When the pose was over Julie
appeared. The artist drew the grey drapery
over the easel and helped Miss Darrow to
descend.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p class="cap">These mornings in the studio were
full of subtleties. Miss Darrow
discovered that Burnett could talk
upon many subjects. He had traveled much
in Europe, and could even draw a bold outline
for her of the East, which she had never
seen. He talked little of art, and then only
when the subject was introduced by his model.
In the rests, which were long, he led Miss
Darrow, often without her being aware of it,
down pleasant lanes of thought, all of which
seemed to end abruptly in the garish sunshine
of personality. She did not find it unpleasant;
only it seemed rather surprising the way all
formality between them had been banished.</p>

<p>One morning there was a diversion. A
clatter on the knocker and Burnett, frowning,
went to the door. Miss Darrow heard a feminine
voice and an exclamation. Burnett went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
rather hurriedly and stood outside, his hand
upon the door knob. There was a murmur of
conversation and a feminine laugh. She tried
not to hear what was said. The hand fidgeted
on the knob, but the murmur of voices continued.
Miss Darrow got down from the
throne and moved to the window, adjusting a
stray curl as she passed.</p>

<p>She looked away from the mirror, then
stopped suddenly and looked again. When
Burnett entered she was sitting in the window-seat,
looking out over the roof-tops. He was
profuse in apology. She resumed the pose
and the artist painted silently. &ldquo;They say
there&rsquo;s a pleasure in painting that only a
painter knows,&rdquo; she began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why do we rest so often? I&rsquo;m not
easily deceived. The fine frenzy is lacking,
Mr. Burnett&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For reply he held out his paint-smudged
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re painting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
timidly with the tips of your fingers&mdash;not in
the least like the &lsquo;Agatha.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re
doing me early-Victorian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett stopped painting, looked at his canvas
and laughed. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s hardly that,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you prove it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By letting me look.&rdquo; She rose from her
chair, got down from the throne and took a
rapid step or two towards the easel. But Burnett&rsquo;s
broad shoulders barred the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; she urged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, really.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; She stood her ground firmly,
looking up into his face, but Burnett did not
move or reply.</p>

<p>She settled into the pose again and Burnett
went mechanically to his place before the canvas.
Once it seemed as if he were about to
speak&mdash;but he thought better of it. He looked
down at the mass of color mingled on the
palette. His brush moved slowly on the canvas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
At last it stopped and dropped to his
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She dropped out of the pose. &ldquo;Are you
ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he laughed. With the setting
aside of the brushes and palette, Burnett
seemed to put away the shadow that had been
hanging over his thoughts all the morning.
He stood beside her and was looking frankly
into her eyes. She saw something in his that
had not been there before, for she looked
away, past the chimneys and apartment
houses, past the clouds, and into the void that
was beyond the blue. She had forgotten his
presence, and one of her hands which he held
in both of his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you understand,&rdquo; he said quietly.
&ldquo;Perhaps you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fingers moved slightly, but on the
brows a tiny frown was gathering. He relinquished
her hand with a sigh and stood
looking rather helplessly in the direction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the mute and pitiless easel. They were so
deep in thought that neither of them heard
the turning of a skeleton key in the latch and
the opening of the door. The Japanese screen
for a moment concealed them from the view
of a gentleman who emerged into the room.
Ross Burnett looked up helplessly. It was
Mortimer Crabb, horror-stricken at this violation
of his sanctum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ross!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what on earth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Darrow started from her chair, the
crimson rushing to her cheeks, and stood
drawing the lace across her shoulders.</p>

<p>Burnett was cool. &ldquo;Miss Darrow,&rdquo; he
asked, &ldquo;you know Mr. Crabb? He&rsquo;s studying
painting, and&mdash;er&mdash;sometimes uses this
place. Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words hung on his lips as he realized
that Miss Darrow with an inclination of the
head toward the visitor, had vanished into the
dressing-room.</p>

<p>As the door closed words less polite came
forth.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>But Crabb broke in: &ldquo;Oh, I say, Ross, you
don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ve had the nerve&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ross Burnett&rsquo;s brows drew together and his
large frame seemed to grow compact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Mort,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
understand. You&rsquo;ve made an awful mess of
things. Won&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear chap&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain later. But go&mdash;please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a glance toward the easel Mortimer
Crabb went out.</p>

<p>Ross Burnett closed the door, shot its bolt
and put his back against it. As the clatter of
Crabb&rsquo;s boots on the wooden stairs died away
on the lower floor, he gave a sigh, folded his
arms and waited.</p>

<p>When Miss Darrow emerged from the
dressing-room ready for the street, she found
him there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My things are in the portmanteau,&rdquo; she
said, icily. &ldquo;My maid will call for them. If
you will permit me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Burnett did not move.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Darrow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you let me pass?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Miss Darrow&mdash;until you hear. I
wouldn&rsquo;t have had it happen for anything in
the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot listen. Won&rsquo;t you open the
door?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bowed his head as though better to
receive her reproaches, but he did not
move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;how could you!&rdquo; Her
chin was raised, and she glanced scornfully at
him from under her narrowed lids.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he pleaded, quietly. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll
only listen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned and walked towards the window.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it punishment enough for it all
to end like this,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;without making
it seem as though I were worse than I am?
Really, I&rsquo;m not as bad as I&rsquo;m painted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate phrase. An awkward
silence followed it, in which he was
conscious that Miss Darrow had turned suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
from the window and was facing the
Thing upon the easel, which was now revealed
to them both in all its uncompromising
ugliness. From the center of a myriad
of streaks of paint something emerged.
Something in dull tones, staring like a Gorgon
from its muddy illusiveness. To Burnett
it had been only a canvas daubed with infelicitous
paint. Now from across the room
it seemed to have put on a smug and scurrilous
personality and odiously leered at him
from its unlovely background.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Burnett. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at
the thing like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the girl did not move. She stood before
the easel, her head a little on one side,
her eyes upon the canvas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really not Victorian, is it?&rdquo; she asked
calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <i>must</i> listen!&rdquo; cried Burnett, leaving
his post at the door. &ldquo;I insist. You know
why I did this mad thing. I&rsquo;ve told you. I&rsquo;d
do it again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt you will,&rdquo; she put in scornfully.
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been so difficult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was. The hardest thing I&rsquo;ve ever done
in my life. You gave me the chance. I took
it. I won&rsquo;t regret it. It was selfish&mdash;brutal&mdash;anything
you like. But I don&rsquo;t regret&mdash;nine
wonderful mornings, twenty-seven precious
hours&mdash;more, I hope, than you&rsquo;ve given
any man in your life.&rdquo; He made one rapid
stride and took her in his arms. &ldquo;I love you,
Millicent, dear. I&rsquo;ve loved you from the
first moment&mdash;there in the picture gallery.
Yes, I&rsquo;d do it again. Every moment I&rsquo;ve
blessed the luck that made it possible. Don&rsquo;t
turn away from me. You don&rsquo;t hate me. I
know it. You couldn&rsquo;t help feeling a response
to a love like mine.&rdquo; He held her
close to him, raising her head at last until
her lips were level with his own. But he did
not touch them. She still struggled faintly,
but she would not open her eyes and look at
him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, you mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was all that she
found strength to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t deny it. You do&mdash;care for
me. Look up at me and tell me so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She would not look at him and at last
struggled away and stood, her cheeks flaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are masterful!&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;A
girl is not to be won in this fashion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I despise you,&rdquo; she gasped. She turned
to the mirror, and rearranged her disordered
hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. Won&rsquo;t you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sank on the model stand and buried
her face in her hands. &ldquo;It was cruel of you&mdash;cruel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sight of her distress unnerved him and
gave him for the first time a new view of the
enormity of his offense. It was her pride that
was wounded. It was the thought of what
Mortimer Crabb might think of her that
had wrought the damage. He bent over her,
his fingers nearly touching her, yet restrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
by a delicacy and a new tenderness begotten
by the thought that it was he alone who had
caused her unhappiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she only repeated. &ldquo;What can he
think of me? What can he think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burnett straightened, a new thought coming
to him. It seemed like an inspiration&mdash;a
stroke of genius.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, calmly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re hopelessly
compromised. He must think what he
pleases. There&rsquo;s only one thing to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She arose and breathlessly asked, &ldquo;What
<i>can</i> I do? How can I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marry me&mdash;at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke the word slowly&mdash;wonderingly&mdash;as
if the idea had never occurred to her before.
He had left the way to the door unguarded,
but instead she walked toward the
window, and looked out over the roof-tops.
To Burnett the silence was burdened with
meaning, and he broke it timorously.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you&mdash;won&rsquo;t you, Millicent, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice trembled a little when she replied:
&ldquo;There is one thing more important
than that&mdash;than anything else in the world
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At her side his eyes questioned mutely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that?&rdquo; he asked at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My reputation,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>He stood a second studying her face, for
his happiness grew upon him slowly. But
behind the crooked smile which was half-hidden
from him, he caught the dawn of a
new light that he understood. He took her
in his arms then, and wondered how it was
that he had not kissed her when her lips had
been so close before. But the new wonder
that came to them both made them willing
to forget that there had ever been anything
else before.</p>

<p>Later, Ross, unable to credit his good fortune
and marveling at the intricacies of the
feminine mind, asked her a question. Her
reply caused him more amazement:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor, foolish, Slovenly Peter! I saw it by
accident in the mirror a week ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it was Mortimer Crabb after all who
made the opportunity; for Miss Darrow
smilingly admitted that had it not been for
his abrupt entrance at that precise psychological
moment, she should now have been in
Aiken and Ross on the way to the Antipodes.
But Patricia was doubly happy; for had
she not circumvented her own husband in
opening the studio he had forsworn, the
veritable chamber of Bluebeard which had
been bolted against her? Had she not
browsed away among the gods of his youth to
her heart&rsquo;s content and made that sacred
apartment the vestibule of Paradise for at
least two discontented mortals whose hearts
were now beating as one?</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p class="cap">After this first success, Patricia was
filled with the spirit of altruism, and
winter and summer went out upon
the highways and byways seeking the raw
material for her fateful loom. She was Puck,
Portia and Patricia all rolled into one. There
were Stephen Ventnor and Jack Masters, whom
she still saw occasionally, but they only sighed
and even refused to dine at the Castle of Enchantment.
She thought sometimes of Heywood
Pennington, too, and often found herself
wondering how the world was faring
with him, hoping that some day chance would
throw him in her way. The old romance
was dead, of course. But what an opportunity
for regeneration!</p>

<p>Meantime she had much to do in keeping
up her establishment, many friends to make
in New York, many social duties to perform.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
She spent much time with her husband over
the plans of the country place he was building
on Long Island, which was to be ready
for occupancy late in the following spring.
Mortimer Crabb had formed a habit of going
down town for a part of every day at least,
and if he really did no work he created an
impression of stability which was rather surprising
to those who had known him longest.
The Crabbs were desirable acquaintances in
the married set, and before two years had
passed, Patricia made for herself an enviable
reputation as a hostess and dinner guest, to say
nothing of that of a model wife. Not a cloud
larger than a speck had risen upon the matrimonial
horizon and their little bark sailed
steadily forward propelled by the mildest of
breezes upon an ocean that was all made up
of ripples and sunshine. Mortimer Crabb
loved abundantly, and Patricia was contented
to watch him worship, while she shaped the
course to her liking.</p>

<p>There were still times, however, when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
sat and watched the flames of the library fire
while she stirred up the embers of romance.
Few women who have been adored as Patricia
had been are willing too abruptly to shut the
door upon the memory of the might-have-beens.
The coquette in her was dying hard&mdash;as
it sometimes does in childless women. She
still liked the attentions to which she had been
accustomed, and her husband saw that she was
constantly amused&mdash;provided with clever men
from his clubs as dance partners for the Philadelphia
girls who visited them. Stephen
Ventnor, who was selling bonds down-town,
had been persuaded at last to forget his troubles
and now came frequently to dinner.
There was nothing Patricia wanted, it seemed,
except something to want.</p>

<p>One day, quite by chance, she met another
one of the might-have-beens upon the street.
She did not know him at first, for he now
wore a small moustache and the years had not
passed as lightly over his head as they had
over hers. She felt her way barred by a tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
figure, and before she knew it, was shaking
hands with Heywood Pennington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patty,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know
me? Does four years make such a difference?&rdquo;
A warm tint rose and spread unbidden
from Patricia&rsquo;s neck to temples. It
angered her that she could not control it, but
she smiled at him and said that she was glad
to see him.</p>

<p>Together they walked up the Avenue, and,
as they went, she questioned and he told her
his story. No recriminations passed. He
made it plain to her that he was too glad to
see her for that. He was in business, he said
vaguely, and in the future was to make New
York his home. So, when she took leave of
him, Patricia asked the prodigal to call. It
will be apparent to anyone that there was
nothing else to do.</p>

<p>Mortimer Crabb received the information
at the dinner table that night with a changeless
expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure if you want Mr. Pennington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
here, he&rsquo;ll be welcome,&rdquo; he said with a slow
smile. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very, very old friend of
yours, isn&rsquo;t he, Patty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;since school days,&rdquo; she said,
quietly. And she blushed again, but if Crabb
noticed, it was not apparent, for he immediately
busied himself with his soup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He used to be such a nice boy,&rdquo; said Patricia.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid he got pretty wild
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; put in her husband, a little dryly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard something about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She glanced at him quickly, but he did not
look up and she went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it would be nice if we could do
a little something for him, give him a lift, introduce
him to some influential people&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make an opportunity for him, in short,&rdquo;
said Crabb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;yes. He has had a pretty hard time,
I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised,&rdquo; said Crabb,
&ldquo;most people do.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Patricia foresaw an opportunity such as
she had never had before, and a hundred
plans at once flashed into her pretty head for
the prodigal&rsquo;s regeneration. First, of course,
she must kill the fatted calf, and she therefore
planned at once a dinner party, at which Mr. Pennington
should meet some of her intimate
friends, Dicky Bowles and his wife, the Burnetts,
who were on from Washington, the
Charlie Chisolms and her sister Penelope.
For reasons of her own Stephen Ventnor was
not invited.</p>

<p>Patricia presided skilfully with an air of
matronly benevolence not to be denied and
dextrously diverted the conversation into
channels strictly impersonal. So that after
dinner, while Charlie Chisolm was still talking
rifle-bores with Mortimer, Patricia and
Heywood Pennington went into the conservatory
to see the new orchids.</p>

<p>That was the first of many dinners. Patricia
invited all the eligible girls of her acquaintance,
one after another, and sat them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
next to Mr. Pennington in an apparent endeavor
to supply the deficiency she had
caused in that gentleman&rsquo;s affections. But new
orchids came continually to the conservatory,
and Patricia was not loath to show them.
Then followed rides in the motor car when
Crabb was down-town, and shopping expeditions
when Crabb was at the club, for which
Patricia chose Heywood Pennington as her
escort, and whatever Mortimer Crabb
thought of it all, he said little and looked less.</p>

<p>But if her husband had been willing to worship
blindly before he and Patricia had been
engaged, marriage had cleared away some of
the nebulæ. He had learned to look upon his
wife as a dear, capricious being, and with the
abounding faith and confidence of amply proportioned
men he was willing to believe that
Patricia, like Cæsar&rsquo;s wife, was above suspicion.
He was quite sure that she was foolish.
But Patty&rsquo;s little finger foolish was more important
to Mortimer than a whole Minerva.</p>

<p>Mr. Pennington&rsquo;s ways were not Crabb&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
ways, however, and the husband learned one
day, quite by chance, of an incident that had
happened in New York which confirmed a
previous impression. He went home a little
sombre, for that very night Mr. Pennington
was to dine again at his house.</p>

<p>After dinner Patricia and Pennington vanished
as usual into the conservatory and were
seen no more until it was time for Patricia&rsquo;s
guests to go. The husband lingered moodily
by the fire after the door had closed upon the
last one, who happened to be the might-have-been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patty,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think it a little&mdash;er&mdash;inhospitable&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mort,&rdquo; Patricia broke in, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be
tiresome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mortimer Crabb had taken out his
watch and was examining it with a judicial
air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, calmly, &ldquo;that
you&rsquo;ve been out there since ten? I don&rsquo;t think
it&rsquo;s quite decent.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the first time her husband had used
exactly this tone, and Patricia looked at him
curiously, then pouted and laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jealous!&rdquo; she laughed, and blowing him a
kiss flew upstairs, leaving her husband still
looking into the fire. But he did not smile as
he usually did when this was her mood, and in
her last backward glance Patricia did not fail
to notice it. Instead of following her, Mortimer
Crabb lit a cigar and went over to his
study. Perhaps he should have spoken more
severely to Patricia before this. He had been
on the point of it a dozen times. Gossip had
dealt with Pennington none too kindly, but
Crabb didn&rsquo;t believe in gossip and he did believe
in his wife.</p>

<p>He finished his cigar and then lit another
while he tried to think the matter out, until,
at last, Patricia, a pretty vision in braids and
lace, came pattering down. He heard the
footfalls and felt the soft hands upon his
shoulders, but did not turn his head. He
knew what was to come and had not the humor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
or the art to compromise. Patricia, with quick
divination, took her hands away and went
around by the fire where she could look at her
husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, half defiantly. Crabb replied
without raising his eyes from the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patty,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t ask
Mr. Pennington to the house.&rdquo; Patricia
looked at him as though she had not heard
aright. But she did not speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must know,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve
been thinking about you and Mr. Pennington
for some time, but I haven&rsquo;t spoken so plainly
before. You mustn&rsquo;t be seen with Mr. Pennington
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose and knocked his cigar ashes into
the chimney and then turned to face his wife.
Patricia&rsquo;s foot was tapping rapidly upon the
fender while her figure presented the picture
of injured dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is preposterous&mdash;impossible,&rdquo; she
gasped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ride with him to-morrow
afternoon.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>And then after a pause in which she eagerly
scanned her husband&rsquo;s face, she broke
forth into a nervous laugh: &ldquo;Upon my word,
Mort, I believe you <i>are</i> jealous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am,&rdquo; said Crabb, slowly, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m in earnest, too. Do what I ask, Patricia.
Don&rsquo;t ride to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I should refuse&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb shrugged his broad shoulders and
turned away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be too bad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how can you do such a thing,&rdquo; she
cried, &ldquo;without a reason&mdash;without any excuse?
Why, Heywood has been here every
day for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and then broke off in confusion.</p>

<p>Crabb smiled rather grimly, but he generously
passed the opportunity by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every reason that I wish&mdash;every excuse
that I need. Isn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t&mdash;I refuse to believe anything
about him.&rdquo; Crabb looked at his wife sombrely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d better say no more. Your attitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
makes it impossible for me to argue
the question. Good-night.&rdquo; He opened the
door and stood waiting for her to go out. She
hesitated a moment and then swept by him,
her very ruffles breathing rebellion.</p>

<p>The next morning he kissed her good-bye
when she was reading her mail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll write him, Patty, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
said, as he went out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; she answered, quickly, &ldquo;I will&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
write him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia did write to him. But it was not
at all the sort of a letter that Crabb would
have cared to see.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dear Heywood [it ran], something has

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p class="cap">Patricia awoke rudely and with an
appalling sense that she had made a
shocking fool of herself. Heywood
Pennington suddenly vanished out of her life
as completely as though Fifth Avenue had
opened and swallowed him. Very suddenly
he had left New York, they said. And upon
her breakfast tray one morning Patricia found
the following in a handwriting unfamiliar
and evidently disguised:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi right">March 12, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>There in her fingers it flaunted its brutality.
What could it mean? Her letters? To Heywood
Pennington? Why&mdash;they were only
notes&mdash;harmless little records of their friendship.
What had she said? How had this
odious Doe&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>It was a week since she had seen the prodigal.
They had quarreled some days ago, for
Mr. Pennington&rsquo;s lazy humor had turned to
a reckless unconvention which had somewhat
startled her. Her secret declaration of independence
had led her a little out of her
depth, and she began to feel more and more
like the child with the jam-pot&mdash;only the
jam-pot was out of all proportion to real jam-pots
and the smears seemed to defy the most
generous use of soap and water. This horrible
Doe was the neighbor&rsquo;s boy who told, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Mortimer Crabb was suddenly invested with
a newly-born parental dignity and wisdom.
Mort! It made her shudder to think of her
husband receiving those letters. She knew
him so well and yet she knew him so little.
She felt tempted to throw all else to the winds
and make a full confession&mdash;of what? of
a childish ingenuousness&mdash;which confession
would magnify a hundred-fold. What had
she to confess? Meetings in the Park? Her
face burned with shame. It would have
seemed less childish if her face had burned
with shame at things a little more tangible.
Lunches in out-of-the-way restaurants, innocent
enough in themselves, whose only pleasure
was the knowledge that she took them unpermitted.
She knew that she deserved to be
stood in the corner or be sent to bed without
her supper, but she quailed at the thought of
meeting her husband&rsquo;s eye. She knew that he
could make it singularly cold and uncompromising.</p>

<p>And the letters. Why hadn&rsquo;t Heywood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
burned them? And yet why should he have?
Pennington&rsquo;s ideas of a compromising position
she realized, with some bitterness, differed
somewhat from hers. And she knew she
<i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> have written anything to regret. She
tried to think, and a phrase here and there recurred
to her. Perhaps Mort might know her
well enough to guess how little they meant&mdash;but
perhaps he didn&rsquo;t. Words written to
another were so desperately easy to misunderstand.</p>

<p>How could these letters have fallen into the
hands of a stranger? The more she thought
of it the more impenetrable became the mystery.
How could this villainous Doe have
guessed her identity? A few of these letters
were signed merely &ldquo;Patty,&rdquo; but most of them
were not signed at all. It was dreadful to be
insulted with no redress at any hand. Five
thousand dollars! The very insignificance of
the figures made her position worse. Was this
the value of her reputation? Truly her fortunes
had sunk to their lowest ebb. She tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to picture John Doe, a small ferret of a man
with heavy eyes, red hair, and a rumpled
shirt-front, sitting in a dingy office up three
flights of stairs, fingering her little scented
notes with his soiled fingers. Oh, it was horrible&mdash;horrible!
Yet how could she escape?
Would she not tarnish her soul still more by
paying the wretched money&mdash;Mort&rsquo;s money&mdash;in
forfeit of her disobedience to him? Every
instinct revolted at the thought. Wouldn&rsquo;t
it be better after all to throw herself upon
Mort&rsquo;s mercy? She knew now how much
bigger and better he was than anything else
in the world. She loved him now. She knew
it. There wouldn&rsquo;t ever be any more might-have-beens.
She longed to feel his protecting
arms about her and hear his quiet steady voice
in her ears, even though it was to scold her for
the mere child that she was. His arms seemed
the greater sanctuary now&mdash;now that she was
not sure that they ever could be opened to
her. Still clasping the letter she buried her
face in the pillows of her couch and wept.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
That night she sent down word that she had a
headache, but a night&rsquo;s rest did wonders. A
cheerful, smiling person descended on Crabb
in the midst of his morning coffee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Patty! At the breakfast table?
Will the wonders never cease?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come to breakfast, Mort. I wanted
to see you before you went out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb smiled over the top of his coffee
cup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Patty? A hat bill or an opera
cloak? I&rsquo;m prepared. Tell me the awful
worst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Mort&mdash;please. I can&rsquo;t bear you
facetious. It&rsquo;s&mdash;er&mdash;about Madame Jacquard&rsquo;s
bill and some others. They&rsquo;ve gotten
a little large and she&mdash;she wants me to help
her out to-day&mdash;if I can&mdash;if you can&mdash;and I
told her I would&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb was wrapped in contemplation of his
muffin. But he allowed his wife to struggle
through to the end. Then he looked up a little
seriously from under heavy brows.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Um&mdash;er&mdash;how much, Patty? A thousand?
I think it can be managed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mort,&rdquo; she interrupted, tremulously,
&ldquo;you see I have had to get so many things of
late&mdash;we&rsquo;ve been going out a great deal you
know&mdash;a lot of other things you wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Perhaps I might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve been rather extravagant
this winter. I didn&rsquo;t tell you but I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
used up my allowance long&mdash;ever so
long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mortimer Crabb&rsquo;s brows were now really
menacing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began. But she
interrupted him at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I ought to be called a beggar on
horseback, because I really have ridden
rather&mdash;rather fast this winter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two thousand?&rdquo; he questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mort, you see, it isn&rsquo;t only the dresses
and the hats. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve been losing more
than I should have lost at auction.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Bridge!&rdquo; he said, pitilessly, &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;bub&mdash;bridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought my warning might be sufficient.
I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; she whispered, her head lowered,
now thoroughly abased. &ldquo;I am not going
to play any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much&mdash;three thousand?&rdquo; he asked
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, desperately, &ldquo;more. I&rsquo;m
afraid it will take five thousand dollars to pay
everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; he whistled. &ldquo;How in the name
of all that&rsquo;s expensive&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; helplessly, &ldquo;money
adds up so fast&mdash;I suppose that father
might help me if you can&rsquo;t&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t
want to ask him if I could help it; you know
he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Crabb, with a sudden move
of the hand. &ldquo;It can be managed, of course,
but I admit I&rsquo;m surprised&mdash;very much surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
that you haven&rsquo;t thought fit to take me
closer into your confidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mort,&rdquo; she muttered, humbly.
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb pushed back his chair and rose.
&ldquo;Oh, well, don&rsquo;t say anything more about it,
Patty. It must be attended to, of course.
Just give me a list of the items and I&rsquo;ll send
out the checks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mort, I&rsquo;d like to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just stop in at Madame Jacquard&rsquo;s on
the way uptown and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patty started up and then sank back weakly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mort, dear,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t
worth while. It would be so much out of
your way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; said Crabb, striding cheerfully
to the door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a step from the subway,
and then I can come on up the Avenue&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Patricia by this time had fastened
tightly upon the lapels of his coat, and was
looking half tearfully up into his face.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I want to see Madame about some
things she hasn&rsquo;t sent up yet&mdash;I must go there
to-day. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell her, Mort, and then if
you&rsquo;ll arrange it, I&rsquo;ll just send it to her to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mortimer Crabb looked into the blue eyes
that she raised to his and relented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you shall have your
own way.&rdquo; And then, with the suspicion of
a smile, &ldquo;Shall I make a check to your order?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To&mdash;to mine, Mort&mdash;it always makes me
feel more important to pay my bills myself&mdash;and
besides&mdash;the bub&mdash;bridge, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Patricia heard the front door shut behind
her husband, she gave a great sigh and
sank on the divan in a state of utter collapse.</p>

<p>The next day Patricia dressed herself in
a plain, dark skirt, a long grey coat and wore
two heavy veils over an unobtrusive sailor hat.
In her hand she clutched a small hand satchel
containing the precious check and the odious
letter of John Doe. First she went to the
bank and converted the check into crisp thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
dollar notes. Then walking rapidly she
took the elevated for that unknown region
which men call down-town. There was little
difficulty in finding the place. The narrow
doorway she had imagined was wide&mdash;even
imposing, and an Irish janitor with a cheerful
countenance, was sweeping the pavement and
whistling. It was not in the least Dickens-ish,
or Machiavellian. The atmosphere was that
of a very cheerful and modern New York and
Patricia&rsquo;s spirits revived. A cleanly boy in
buttons ran the elevator.</p>

<p>But as the elevator shot up, Patty&rsquo;s heart
shot down. She had hoped there would be
stairs to climb. The imminence of the visit
filled her with alarm, and before she realized
it, she was deposited&mdash;a bundle of quivering
nerves, before the very door. Gathering her
shattered forces together, she knocked timorously
and entered. It was a cheerful room
with a bright carpet and an outlook over the
river. A small boy who sat inside a wooden
railing, sprang up and came forward.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to see Mr. Doe,&rdquo; stammered Patty,
&ldquo;Mr. John Doe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must be a mistake,&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;This
is Fairman &amp; Brookes, Investments. Nobody
that name here, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment an elderly man of very
proper appearance came forward from an inner
office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Crabb?&rdquo; he inquired, politely. &ldquo;That
will do, Dick, you may go inside,&rdquo; and then
rather quizzically: &ldquo;You wished to see Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Doe?
Mr. John Doe? I think
he was expecting you. If you&rsquo;ll wait a moment
I&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; and he entered a door which
led to another office.</p>

<p>Patricia dropped into a chair by the railing
completely baffled. This villainous creature
expected her! How could he expect her?
It was only Friday and the appointment was
not until the Wednesday of the following
week. She looked at her surroundings, trying
to find a flaw in their prosperous garb of respectability.
That such rascality could exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
under the guise of decent business! And the
benevolent person who had carried her name
might very properly serve upon the vestry of
St. &mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s church! Truly there were depths
of iniquity in this vile community of business
people that her little social plummet could
never seek to sound. The little red-headed
man with the ferret eyes had vanished from
her mind. In his place she saw a type even
more alarming&mdash;the sleek, well-groomed man
with dissipated eyes that she and Mort had
often seen dining at popular restaurants. Her
mission would not be as easy to accomplish
as it had seemed. Her speech to the ferret-eyed
man which she had so carefully rehearsed
had gone completely from her mind. What
she should say to this other man, whom she
both loathed and feared, her vagrant wits refused
to invent. So in spite of a brave poise of
the head she sat in a kind of syncope of dismay,
and awaited&mdash;she knew not what.</p>

<p>The benevolent vestryman returned smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Doe has just come in, Mrs. Crabb. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
you&rsquo;ll kindly come this way.&rdquo; He opened the
door and stood aside with an old-world courtliness
that all but disarmed her. He followed
her into the inner corridor and opened another
door, smiling the while, and Patricia,
trembling from head to foot, yet resolute, went
in, while the elderly person carefully closed
the door behind her. A tall figure in an overcoat
and soft hat was bending over the fireplace
upon the opposite side of the room adjusting
a log.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Doe?&rdquo; came in a small, muffled voice
from behind Patricia&rsquo;s veil.</p>

<p>The man at the fireplace still poked at the
logs and made no move to take off his hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The brute&mdash;the utter brute,&rdquo; thought Patricia&mdash;and
then aloud, &ldquo;Mr. Doe, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam,&rdquo; said a voice at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
John Doe&mdash;what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came about the letters&mdash;the letters, you
know, you wrote me about. I am prepared
to&mdash;to redeem them.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;H&mdash;m,&rdquo; growled the overcoat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Crabb, isn&rsquo;t it? Mrs. Crabb? I&rsquo;m always getting
the Cobb and Crabb letters mixed&mdash;six of
one and half a dozen of the other&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; faltered Patty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cases very similar. Bad man&mdash;good
woman. Trusting husband&mdash;hey? Well,&rdquo;
he muttered brutally, &ldquo;did you bring the
money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; said Patricia, trembling. &ldquo;Now
the letters&mdash;and let me go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man moved slowly toward a desk
against the wall with his back still turned,
took out a package, rose and, turning, handed
it to Patricia.</p>

<p>Had her gaze not been fixed so eagerly upon
the handwriting on the package she could not
have failed to note the smiling gray eyes above
the upturned coat collar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it is sealed and addressed to me!&rdquo;
she cried, in surprise. &ldquo;The package hasn&rsquo;t
even been opened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never said it had,&rdquo; said the man in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
overcoat, removing his hat. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want
to read the stuff, Patty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The package fell to the floor amid the fluttering
bills. Patricia&rsquo;s knees trembled and
she would have fallen had not a pair of strong
arms gone about her and held her up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Mort, Patty,&rdquo; said a voice.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand? It&rsquo;s all been a deception
and mistake. There isn&rsquo;t any John
Doe. It&rsquo;s only your husband&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how could you, Mort?&rdquo; sobbed Patricia.
&ldquo;How could you be so hard&mdash;so&mdash;so
cruel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb&rsquo;s answer was to push the veil back
from his wife&rsquo;s face and kiss away her tears.
She did not resist now and sank against him
with a restful sigh that told him more than
any words could do the full measure of her
penitence. But in a moment she started up
pale and wide-eyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this office&mdash;these people&mdash;do they
know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless you, no,&rdquo; laughed Crabb. &ldquo;Fairman&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a sort of business associate of mine. I
only borrowed his private office for an hour or
so. He thinks it is a practical joke. It was&mdash;is&mdash;a
cruel one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll guess&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; laughed Crabb.</p>

<p>Patricia&rsquo;s gaze fell quietly upon the floor
where the bills and the package still lay in
disordered confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the letters&mdash;you never even read
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Patty,&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
want to read &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you ever forgive me, Mort?&rdquo; She
broke away from him, bent to the floor, picked
up the package, and broke the seal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you <i>shall</i> read them, Mort,&rdquo; she cried,
her face flaming, &ldquo;every last silly one of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Crabb&rsquo;s hands closed over hers and
took the package gently from her. His only
answer was to throw the papers into the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mort,&rdquo; she murmured, horrified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
&ldquo;what have you done&mdash;you might believe
<i>anything</i> of me now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s your penance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Mort&mdash;there&rsquo;s time yet&mdash;just read
a few&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crabb poked vigorously at the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mort, it&rsquo;s inhuman! You only knew
Heywood Pennington&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Crabb, putting his hand over
her lips. &ldquo;No names&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no.&rdquo; And then, after a pause, &ldquo;He
wasn&rsquo;t even a might-have-been, Patty.&rdquo; She
said no more. They sat hand in hand watching
the record of Patricia&rsquo;s foolishness go up
in smoke. And when the last scrap had vanished,
he sprang cheerfully to his feet and
picked up the scattered bills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Patty, luncheon! And after that&rdquo;&mdash;Mortimer
Crabb stopped again and blinked
quizzically at the fire&mdash;&ldquo;hadn&rsquo;t we better keep
your engagement&mdash;with Madame Jacquard?&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p class="cap">Thus ended the might-have-beens.
And the thing that Patricia had
taken to be the phantom of romance
went up in the smoke of John Doe&rsquo;s fire.
Mortimer Crabb never volunteered any information
as to how he got the letters, nor any
information as to what became of Heywood
Pennington. For one horrible moment the
thought crossed Patricia&rsquo;s brain that perhaps
there had never been any letters of hers in the
package her husband had burned, but she dismissed
it at once as reflecting unpleasantly
upon the quality of her intelligence. But one
thing was sure, she now had an adequate understanding
of the mind of her husband. It
was the only misunderstanding they had ever
had and Patricia knew there would never be
another. Mr. Pennington did not appear
again and so far as this veracious history is<span class="ispan pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
concerned, after his departure from New
York, may have gone at once to Jericho. Patricia
ceased to think of him, not because he
was not present, but because thinking of him
reminded her that she had been a fool, and
no woman with the reputation for cleverness
which Patricia possessed, could afford to
make such an admission even to herself. She
was now sure of several things&mdash;that she loved
Mortimer Crabb with all her heart&mdash;and that
she would never all her life long love anyone
else. She might flirt, yes&mdash;nay more, she <i>must</i>
flirt. What was the use spending one&rsquo;s life
in bringing an art to the perfection Patricia
had attained and then suddenly forswearing
it? Fortunately her husband did not require
that of her. He never quite knew what she
was going to do next, but he never really mistrusted
her. And to Patricia&rsquo;s credit it may
be said that she never caused pain and that if
she flirted&mdash;she sometimes did&mdash;it was in a
good cause.</p>

<p>The building of the country place had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
forward during the winter, and early summer
found them installed there. Beginning with
the housewarming, which was memorable,
guests came and went and upon them all Patricia
practiced her altruism which, since the
adventure with John Doe, had taken a somewhat
different character. Yet even among
these she found work for her busy hands to do.</p>

<p>It happened that among their guests the
Crabbs had staying with them as a remnant
of the housewarming party a young girl who,
because she was only a little younger than
Patricia in years, but centuries younger in
knowledge of the world, had become one of
her most treasured friends.</p>

<p>Little Miss North loved her, too&mdash;looked
up to her as the ignorant do to the wise, and
when her engagement to the Baron DeLaunay
was announced Aurora came and told Patricia
even before she told her family. Yet Patricia&rsquo;s
shrewd mind found something wrong
and she urged the girl to come and join her
housewarming for the sole reason of finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
out the true inwardness of the engagement,
and perhaps, too&mdash;who shall say?&mdash;to practice
her arts again.</p>

<p>After a day or two of mild questioning, of
studying, of watching, she began to see
light.</p>

<p>Then she invited the Baron for a week end,
and made certain preparations.</p>

<p>Then she waited his arrival with her nerves
tingling.</p>

<p>She met her husband and the Baron at the
steps as they ascended from the machine
which brought them from the station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah monsieur! so glad! I was wondering
if you&rsquo;d be here in time for tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wild horses could not have detained me
longer, from a glimpse of your <i>beaux yeux</i>,
Madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bent forward with a handsome gesture
and kissed the tips of Patricia&rsquo;s fingers, but
she laughed gaily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste pretty speeches, Baron. Besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
she paused significantly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
pointed toward the door through which her
husband&rsquo;s shoulders had disappeared, &ldquo;she is
there,&rdquo; she finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Hélas!</i>&rdquo; The Frenchman shrugged his
shoulders expressively; then straightened and
showed his teeth in a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since my speeches are wasted, I will follow
you in, Madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the world loves a lover&mdash;even I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could be sure that you loved&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her,&rdquo; sternly.</p>

<p>He shrugged again, &ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;I love her&mdash;of
course! Why, otherwise, should I wish to
marry her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; slowly, &ldquo;why you speak of my
<i>beaux yeux</i>?&rdquo; she said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I cannot help it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lover should be blind,&rdquo; she put in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like a husband?&rdquo; he asked, significantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like a wife,&rdquo; she corrected, soberly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>He followed her indoors, where Aurora
met them at the door of the library.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tea, Aurora,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;Will you
pour it? Mort and I will be in in a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hovered in the doorway insistently until
she saw DeLaunay safely seated on the
davenport at the tea-table by Aurora&rsquo;s side,
and only then she departed in the direction of
the smoking room.</p>

<p>Mortimer Crabb was drinking a glass of
whiskey and water. At the sound of his wife&rsquo;s
voice he turned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get it, Mort?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>For reply he fumbled in the pockets of his
dust-coat and brought forth a small package.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Here it is. Pretty insignificant
affair to make such a fuss about,&rdquo; and he
handed it to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the little things that mean the most,
my dear husband&mdash;like that,&rdquo; she said significantly,
&ldquo;and this,&rdquo; and she kissed him for his
reward.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>He held her away from him and looked at
her good-humoredly&mdash;the quizzical humor
that was characteristic of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never kiss me unless you&rsquo;re up to some
mischief, Patty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to be glad I&rsquo;m mischievous,
Mort. It&rsquo;s an ill wind that blows nobody
any good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&mdash;m. Why all the mystery? Can&rsquo;t you
tell a fellow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because then you don&rsquo;t know as much as
I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
your husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because if you knew as much as I do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
She paused. &ldquo;You know, Mort, it&rsquo;s only the
ignorant husband who&rsquo;s entirely, blissfully
happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about that,&rdquo; he laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you happy, Mort?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, hang it, yes. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s nothing left to be said,&rdquo; and
she kissed him again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laid resisting fingers on his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s one of your
charms, Mort, dear. It&rsquo;s much better for a
woman to be misunderstood. The husband
who &lsquo;understands&rsquo; his wife is on the highway
to purgatory. Ask no more questions. If I
answer them I surely will lie to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the deuce can Daggett and McDade
be doing for you. They&rsquo;re job-printers. They
don&rsquo;t engrave your cards or stationery or anything&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;&mdash;o,&rdquo; with a rising inflection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I needed some printing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why not go to Tiffany&rsquo;s? The idea
of your sending me away over on the East
side&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re such adorable printers, Mort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who ever heard of a printer being adorable?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Fudge! What&rsquo;s the game now? Can&rsquo;t
you tell a fellow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; firmly.</p>

<p>Crabb always recognized the note of finality
in his wife&rsquo;s voice, so he merely shrugged his
shoulders and followed her with his eyes as
she blew another kiss in his direction and vanished
up the stairs.</p>

<p>In the privacy of her own room Patricia did
some cryptic things with newspapers, a pair
of scissors, and the package from the adorable
printers, and when she had finished, she folded
up the newspapers, with their mysterious
contents, including the scissors, and with a
fleeting glance at herself in the mirror, went
down stairs.</p>

<p>She entered the library noiselessly and after
a glance at her guests at the tea-table, she
slipped her package into the drawer of the
library table and joined them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How envious you make me&mdash;you two,&rdquo; she
sighed, sinking into a chair, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re so satisfied
with yourselves&mdash;and with each other.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>DeLaunay smiled and fingered his tea-cup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you have it otherwise?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she said lightly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a professional
nursery governess to polite and well-meaning
persons of opposite sexes. Nursery
governesses are not permitted emotions or
opinions of any kind, my dears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But even nursery governesses are human,
I am told,&rdquo; said DeLaunay, showing his white
teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they? <i>My</i> governesses never were.
They were all inhuman&mdash;like me. The sight
of youthful license arouses all my professional
instincts. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m in such demand by
despairing mothers of romantic heiresses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patty! you&rsquo;re horrid.&rdquo; Aurora&rsquo;s heavily
lidded eyes opened wide. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not romantic&mdash;not
in the least&mdash;and I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> an heiress&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Patricia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; Aurora amended, &ldquo;not in the
modern sense. But it wouldn&rsquo;t matter to
Louis or to me if we&mdash;really had to work for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
our living. I&rsquo;m so anxious to be of some use
in the world. Oh, we&rsquo;ve planned that already,
haven&rsquo;t we, Louis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said DeLaunay, crisply, with a
glance of defiance in his eye for Patricia. &ldquo;We
have planned that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia&rsquo;s lips twisted, but she said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sometimes think, Patty,&rdquo; went on Aurora,
&ldquo;that you&rsquo;re a little unsympathetic.
Won&rsquo;t you really like to see us married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia laughed. &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;but not to
each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too much in love, dear, for one
thing. <i>C&rsquo;est si bourgeois&mdash;n&rsquo;est-ce-pas, Baron?</i>
Things are arranged better in France?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your customs in America are very pleasant
ones,&rdquo; he replied, imperturbably. &ldquo;I am
indeed fortunate to find myself so much in
accord with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aurora gave him a rapturous glance for reward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and he took her fingers in his in calm
defiance of his pretty hostess.</p>

<p>Patricia put down her finished tea-cup with
a laugh and rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I can&rsquo;t dismay you&mdash;either of
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aurora smiled scornfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least&mdash;can she, Louis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, your blood upon your own
heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or in our hearts, Madame,&rdquo; corrected DeLaunay,
with a bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Aurora,&rdquo; smiled Patricia, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
time to dress.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Patricia spent some time and some thought
upon her toilet. Deep sea-green was her
color, for it matched her eyes, which to-night
were unfathomable. In the midst of her
dainty occupation she turned her head over
her shoulder and called her husband. Mortimer
Crabb appeared in the door of his dressing-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
which adjoined, one side of his face
shaved, the other white with lather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>

<p>Patricia contemplated the back of her head
at the dressing-table by the aid of a hand mirror,
removed the hairpins one by one from her
mouth and deliberately placed them before
she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mort,&rdquo; she said, slowly, &ldquo;I want you to
take Aurora out for a ride in the motor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night! Oh, I say, Patty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; she said, firmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll arrange
it. It will be dark and you&rsquo;re going to lose
your way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I tell you so, stupid! You&rsquo;ve <i>got</i>
to lose your way&mdash;for three hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her shrewdly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now? Tell me, won&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m
tired of rolling over and playing dead. I am.
Besides, what can I do with that girl for three
hours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Patricia. &ldquo;Tell her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
stories&mdash;romantic ones. She likes those. Anything&mdash;make
love to her if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So DeLaunay can make love to <i>you</i>,&rdquo; peevishly.
&ldquo;I see. I&rsquo;m not going to stand for it.
I&rsquo;m not any too keen on that fellow as it is.
He&rsquo;s neglecting Aurora shamefully&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> careless of him, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said,
tilting her head back to get another angle on
her head-dress.</p>

<p>Crabb took a step nearer, brandishing his
safety razor in righteous indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame, I tell you. You don&rsquo;t seem to
have any conscience or any sense of proportion.
You&rsquo;d flirt with a cigar-Indian if there
wasn&rsquo;t anything else around. Why can&rsquo;t you
leave these young people alone? Do you
think I like the idea of your spending the evening
here snug and warm with that Frenchman
while I&rsquo;m shuttling around with that silly
girl in the dark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mortimer, you&rsquo;re ungallant! What has
poor Aurora ever done to you?&rdquo; She turned
in her chair, looked at him, and then burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
into laughter. He watched her with a puzzled
frown. He never knew exactly how to
take Patricia when she laughed at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you only knew how funny you look,
Mort, dear. There&rsquo;s a smudge of soap on the
end of your nose and you look like a charlotte
russe.&rdquo; She rose slowly, put her fingers
on his arm, and looked up into his eyes with
a very winning expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, dear,&rdquo; she said, softly.
&ldquo;You know you said you weren&rsquo;t going to
doubt me again&mdash;ever. I know what I&rsquo;m
about. I have a duty, a sacred duty to perform
and you&rsquo;re going to take your share of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A duty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to know until it&rsquo;s
all over. You mustn&rsquo;t question, you&rsquo;re to be
good and do exactly what I tell you to do.
Won&rsquo;t you, Mort? There, I knew you would.
It&rsquo;s such a little thing to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She leaned as close to him as she could
without getting soap on her face.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you a secret if you&rsquo;ll promise to be
nice. I don&rsquo;t like the man&mdash;really I don&rsquo;t&mdash;not
at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked in her eyes and believed her.
&ldquo;You always get your way in the end, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; he said, after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. What would be the <i>use</i>
of a way, if one didn&rsquo;t <i>have</i> it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That seemed unanswerable logic, so Crabb
grinned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a queer one, Patty,&rdquo; which, as Patricia
knew, meant that she was the most extraordinary
and wonderful of persons. So she
smiled at the back of his head as he went out
because she agreed with him.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p class="cap">Patricia&rsquo;s dinner drew to its delectable
close, and coffee had already been
served when the butler went to the
front door and brought back a telegram on a
silver tray.</p>

<p>Patricia picked it up and turned it over
daintily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For you, Aurora,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Aurora with apologies tore open the envelope
and read, her brow clouding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s nothing serious,&rdquo; said Patricia,
sweetly sympathetic.</p>

<p>Aurora rose hurriedly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she
said dubiously, and then reading: &ldquo;&lsquo;Aunt
Jane sick, motor over this evening if possible.&rsquo;
There&rsquo;s no signature. I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to
go.&rdquo; Her lip protruded childishly. &ldquo;How
tiresome!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very inconsiderate of her, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
said Patricia. The look of incomprehension
still lingered on the young girl&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see what she wants of me,&rdquo; she
murmured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;s seriously ill,&rdquo; Patricia volunteered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;yes, I must go, of course. But
how can I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mortimer,&rdquo; Patricia provided the cue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive you, Aurora,&rdquo; said Crabb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Louis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>DeLaunay made no sign.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take care of the Monsieur DeLaunay,
dear. Do you think you could trust
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aurora&rsquo;s lips said, &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; but her eyes
winked rapidly several times as she adapted
her mind to the situation.</p>

<p>The decision reached, DeLaunay stepped
forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wish that I should go&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite unnecessary,&rdquo; put in Patricia, quickly.
&ldquo;If your aunt Jane is sick, Aurora&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Aurora hung in the wind a regretful moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;he&rsquo;d be in the way. I&rsquo;ll leave
him with you, Patty. Please don&rsquo;t flirt any
more than you can help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said Patty, with solemn
conviction, &ldquo;since poor, foolish Freddy Winthrop,
engaged men are <i>taboo</i>. Besides, to-night
I have other plans. I would not flirt if
you could animate the Apollo Belvedere. As
Mortimer so chastely puts it, &lsquo;me for the
downy at 10 G. M.&rsquo; Monsieur will doubtless
practice pool-shots or play a game of Napoleon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said the Frenchman, with a
calmness which scarcely concealed the note of
derision.</p>

<p>But Aurora, after one long look in his
direction, had vanished to don motor clothing,
and when she came down, Mortimer
Crabb with his quivering car awaited her in
the drive. Patricia and the Baron waved
them good-by from the porch and then went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
indoors to the subtle effulgence of the drawing
room. Patricia walked to the mantel,
turned her back to the fire and stretched her
shapely arms along its shelf, facing her guest
with level gaze and a smile which was something
between a taunt and a caress. DeLaunay
inhaled luxuriously the smoke of his cigarette
and appraised his hostess through the half-closed
eyes of the artist searching for a &ldquo;motif.&rdquo;
She was puzzling&mdash;this woman&mdash;like
the vagrant color in a landscape in the afternoon
sunlight, which shimmered one moment
in the sun and in the next was lost in
shadowy mystery&mdash;not the mystery of the
solemn hills, but the playful mystery of the
woodland brook which laughs mockingly
from secret places. Her eyes were laughing
at him. He felt it, though none of the
physical symbols of laughter were offered in
evidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Monsieur,&rdquo; she began in
French. &ldquo;It is <i>such</i> a pity. There is no excuse
for any one to have a sick aunt when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
stage is set for sentiment. I had planned your
evening so carefully, too&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the soul of kindness, Madame,&rdquo;
he said politely, still studying her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on, slowly, &ldquo;I think I am.
But then I am <i>chez moi</i>, and charity, you
know, begins at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will not call it charity. Charity
they say is cold. And you, Madame, whatever
you would seek to express, are not
cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your eyes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My <i>beaux yeux</i> again.&rdquo; She shrugged her
shoulders, and turned toward the door. &ldquo;It
is time, I think, for you to practice pool-shots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are cruel!&rdquo; He stepped before her
and held out protesting hands. &ldquo;I do not care
for pool, Madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or Napoleon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I wish to talk with you. Please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused, appraising him sideways.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have some letters to write,&rdquo; she said,
briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Madame.&rdquo; He stood before her,
his slender figure gracefully bent, motioning
appealingly toward the deep davenport,
which was set invitingly in front of the fire.
She followed his gesture with her eyes, then
with a light laugh passed before him and sat
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing about my <i>beaux yeux</i> then,&rdquo; she
mocked.</p>

<p>He glanced at her with a smile which
showed his fine teeth and sank beside her and
at a distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Voilà</i>, Madame! You see? I am an angel
of discretion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled approvingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we
understand each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do we?&rdquo; he asked with a suggestion of effrontery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure. To me you are still a mystery.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I? That&rsquo;s curious. I&rsquo;ve tried to make
my meaning plain. Perhaps I can make it
clearer. For some weeks you have been making
love to me, Monsieur. I don&rsquo;t like it. I
never flirt, except with the very ancient or the
very youthful,&rdquo; she said mendaciously. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t come within my age limits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed gayly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love is of all ages and no ages. I am both
ancient and youthful. Old in hope, young in
despair&mdash;in affairs of the heart, I assure you,
a veritable babe in the arms. I have never
really loved&mdash;until now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you marry Aurora then?&rdquo; she put
in.</p>

<p>He looked at her with a puzzled brow, then
laughed merrily. &ldquo;Madame, you are too
clever to waste your time in America.&rdquo; But
as Patricia was looking very gravely into the
fire, he too relapsed into silence, and frowned
at the ash of his cigarette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not see, Madame, why we should
speak of her,&rdquo; he said, sulkily. &ldquo;It must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
clear to you that our understanding is complete.
The marriages in my country, as you
know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I know,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;but
Miss North is different. She has not the social
ambitions of other girls. Miss North is romantic
but quite unspoiled. Has it occurred
to you that perhaps she may hope for a somewhat
different relation between you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are good friends&mdash;very good friends.
She is enchanting,&rdquo; he said with enthusiasm,
&ldquo;so innocent of the ways of the world, so talented,
so charming. We shall be very
happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; dryly.</p>

<p>He examined her shrewdly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have her happiness close to your
heart! Is it not so? What is to be feared?
I shall be very good to her. We understand
each other. She will be glad of the splendor
of my ancient name, and I desire the means to
restore my estates and place myself in a position
of influence among my people. I care for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
her as one cares for a lovely flower&mdash;but the
mind&mdash;the soul, Madame, I have found them&mdash;elsewhere,&rdquo;
he leaned forward and touched
her fingers with his own.</p>

<p>Patricia&rsquo;s gaze was far away. It seemed
as though she was unconscious of his touch.
&ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;a great pity. I
am very sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you not learn to care a little?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned on him then, but her voice was
still gentle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not in France, Monsieur,&rdquo; she said
coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does that matter?&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Love
knows nothing of geography. Love is a cosmopolite.
It cares not for time or place or
convention. I care for you very much, Madame,
and whatever you may think, it makes
me happy to tell you so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Aurora?&rdquo; Patricia reiterated the
word, like the clanging of an alarm bell.</p>

<p>The Baron relaxed his grasp and lowered
his head.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>She leaned forward, elbow on knee, looking
into the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, Baron, I&rsquo;m very sorry for
Aurora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he made no comment she went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has always been a very sweet, amiable,
honorable child. I&rsquo;m very fond of her. She
was very much alone with her books and her
family. She has always lived in an atmosphere
of her own&mdash;an atmosphere that she
made for herself, without companions of her
own age. Her mother brought her up without
the slightest knowledge of the guile, the
deceit, or wickedness of the world in which
some day she was to live. They used even to
scan the newspapers before she was permitted
to read them, and clip out objectionable paragraphs.
Even I have done that since she has
been here visiting me. Her father was always
too busy making money to bother. At the age
of twenty she is still a dreamer, old in nothing
but years, living in an idyl of her own, the
sleeping princess in the fairy-tale whom you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the gallant prince, have awakened with a
kiss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>DeLaunay&rsquo;s shoulders moved slightly as he
sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That kiss, Monsieur! You have awakened
her,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;to what?&rdquo; She paused
abruptly and turned toward him for a reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your question is hardly flattering to
my vanity,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;There are
women&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All women are children. I shall find
means to make her happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia resumed her study of the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so. With money your opportunities
for happiness would be greater. Without
money&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she paused and shook her
head slowly.</p>

<p>The Baron turned abruptly, but Patricia&rsquo;s
gaze was fixed upon the fire. When he spoke
his tones were suppressed&mdash;his manner constrained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>She faced him slowly, her expression gently
sympathetic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you not heard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard what, Madame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of Monsieur North&rsquo;s misfortune&mdash;you
must have seen it in the newspapers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The newspapers! No&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur North has lost his money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>DeLaunay rose quickly, one hand before
him as though to ward off a blow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you tell me is impossible,&rdquo; he said
thickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; gravely. &ldquo;It is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared at her unbelieving, but her eyes
met his calmly, eagerly, and in their depths
he saw only pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would I not have heard this dreadful
thing, Madame? Aurora would have told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She might have told you if she had
known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did not know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They want to save her the pain. They always
have. That is one reason why she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
stopping here with me. Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>DeLaunay showed other signs of inquietude
and was now pacing the rug nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is incredible!&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;incredible!
I cannot&mdash;no&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And he stopped
before her. &ldquo;No, I will not believe it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia clasped her hands over her knees
and was looking very gravely into the fire.
She had the air of a person who is mourning
the loss of a very dear friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know this?&rdquo; he asked again,
anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Mrs. North a week ago, when she
let Aurora come to me. But it is no secret
now, as it has been in the newspapers. I have
kept them from Aurora. She is so happy here
with you&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to do anything
to destroy her pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But North and Company is a very great
business house. So rich that even in France
we have heard of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Mr. North has been rich for years,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and then with a sigh, &ldquo;It is very sad&mdash;very,
very sad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how could such a thing happen?
Surely he is wise enough&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speculation!&rdquo; said Patricia, simply. &ldquo;All
of our business men speculate. Even the oldest&mdash;the
wisest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>DeLaunay sank into a chair at some distance,
his head in his hands. &ldquo;<i>Dieu!</i>&rdquo; she
heard him mutter. &ldquo;What a terrible country.
I cannot believe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia got up at last and walked over and
put her hand quietly on his shoulder. She
was even smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry, Monsieur. Of course you
know that, don&rsquo;t you? But I am sure everything
will turn out for the best. Aurora loves
you. You must remember that poverty will
make no difference in the relations between
you. She will even welcome the chance to
be poor&mdash;she wants to be of some real use in
the world&mdash;she has said so&mdash;you had even
planned that, Monsieur!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>The Frenchman turned just one look in her
direction, a look in which despair, inquietude,
inquiry and anger were curiously blended and
then rose and strode the length of the room
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mocking me. You know, Madame&mdash;that&mdash;that
it is impossible&mdash;this marriage&mdash;if&mdash;what
you tell me is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could reassure you,&rdquo; slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What proofs have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t my word enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want confirmation. Very well!&rdquo;
Patricia walked to the library table, opened
its drawer, and took out the <i>Sun</i> and <i>Herald</i>.
As she opened them two paper cuttings and
a pair of scissors fell to the floor. She picked
them up before DeLaunay could reach her,
opening the newspapers, both of which bore
signs of mutilation. And while he wondered
what she was about to do or say, she resumed
calmly, even indifferently. &ldquo;I had clipped
these papers that Aurora might not see them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Since you profess some incredulity, perhaps
you&rsquo;d rather read for yourself.&rdquo; And she
handed them to him.</p>

<p>He adjusted his monocle with trembling
fingers, and began reading the slips, his lips
moving, his eyes dilated, while Patricia
watched him, her eyes masked by her fingers.
She saw him read one article through, then
scan the other, his lips compressed, his small
chin working forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five million dollars!&rdquo; he whispered at last.
&ldquo;It is terrible&mdash;terrible. And there will be
nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks so, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Read
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he read the remainder of it aloud,
pausing at each sentence as though fascinated
by the horror of it. When he had read the
last word, the papers dropped from his fingers
upon the tea-table beside him. At a grimace
his eye-glass dropped the length of its
cord and he stood erect, squaring his shoulders
and straightening to his small height<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
with the air of a man who has made a resolution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, more calmly, &ldquo;this is
very disagreeable news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite sad, isn&rsquo;t it? But I must warn
you against speaking to Aurora just yet. The
news is spreading fast enough and to-morrow
it may be necessary to tell her. In the meanwhile
you must be gentle with her and
tender&mdash;you can comfort her so much.
She will need all your kindness now, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But DeLaunay had taken out his watch.
&ldquo;Madame, I thank you for your kindness to
me, but I am&mdash;I am much perturbed&mdash;I&mdash;I
do not want to see Miss North until I can
think what I must do. Would you mind if
I went in town to my hotel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will think it strange for you to go
without a word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You could leave a note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will permit me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia watched him seat himself heavily
at her writing-desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;what will you say
to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I am ill&mdash;that I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will that help either you or her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders hopelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then, Madame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;It is a
very painful note to write. I am very sorry
for you, sorry for Miss North, sorry for myself
that you learned of this through me. It
is curious that no one told you,&rdquo; she sighed.
&ldquo;But perhaps it is just as well that you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am grateful, Madame, I cannot tell you
how grateful,&rdquo; he began, but she held up her
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It pains me to see Miss North unhappy,
but I know more of life than she does. I was
educated in France, Monsieur, and I know
what is expected of American girls who marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
into the <i>ancienne noblesse</i>&mdash;the <i>noblesse de
souche</i>. Of course, without a <i>dot</i>, this marriage
is impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Madame, that is true. It is&mdash;impossible,
absolutely impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aurora&mdash;Miss North believes in your love
for her&mdash;she will hardly understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>DeLaunay swung around in his chair and
rose, facing the hostess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be no misunderstanding between
us,&rdquo; decisively, &ldquo;I shall go at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your decision&mdash;your final decision?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;final.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time she stood beside him at the
desk, and as she spoke her finger pointed to
the paper and ink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you must write her to-night&mdash;before
you go. It would not be fair to leave matters
to me. It is not fair to her or to yourself. Sit
down, Monsieur, and write.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sank into the chair again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what shall I write?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can help you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; sweetly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will write what you say,&rdquo; with a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>So Patricia seated herself beside him and
with a troubled brow dictated in English.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noi">&ldquo;My dear Miss North:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have learned with horror and dismay of
the great bereavement which has fallen upon
you and your family, but in view of this misfortune,
I have thought it wisest to take my
departure at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will understand, of course, that under
these conditions it is advisable to discontinue
our present relations at once, and as my presence
might prove embarrassing I leave with
feelings of great unhappiness. You are doubtless
aware of the customs of my country in the
matter of settlements, the absence of which
would preclude the possibility of marriage on
my part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Crabb has kindly consented to make
my apologies and excuses to you for my abrupt
departure which I take with deep regret, the
deeper because of my profound esteem for
your many delightful qualities, of which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
may be assured I shall never cease to think
with tender and regretful sentiments&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Patricia broke off abruptly. &ldquo;I think that
is all, Monsieur. Will you finish it&mdash;as you
please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The baron nodded and added:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I am, Mademoiselle, with profound assurances
of my friendship and consideration,</p>

<p class="noi right">
&ldquo;Yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Louis Charles Bertram de Chartres,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Baron DeLaunay.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Patricia meanwhile had ordered the
Baron&rsquo;s suitcase packed and had &rsquo;phoned for a
station wagon and a while later stood in the
hallway speeding the parting guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must you go, Monsieur? I am so very
sorry. I understand, of course. I am the
loser.&rdquo; And with all the generosity of a victorious
general whose enemy is no longer dangerous.
&ldquo;If you are nice you may kiss my
hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As DeLaunay bent over her fingers he murmured:
&ldquo;If it had only been <i>you</i>, Madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in a moment he had gone.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p class="cap">Patricia stood in the hallway a moment
looking at the note to Aurora,
which she held in her fingers. Then
she went to the desk so recently vacated by her
guest and wrote steadily for an hour. Her
thesis was the international marriage, and she
called it Crabb vs. DeLaunay, enclosing two
papers, DeLaunay&rsquo;s note and the newspaper
clippings from her adorable printers. Slips
of paper were pinned to them, upon one of
which she had written &ldquo;Exhibit A,&rdquo; and on
the other &ldquo;Exhibit B.&rdquo; She sealed them all in
a long envelope addressed to Miss North and
handed it to Aurora&rsquo;s maid with instructions
that it should be given to her mistress when
she had gone up to her room.</p>

<p>From her own bed Patricia heard the motor
arrive and her husband fuming in the hallway
below, the sound of Aurora&rsquo;s door closing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and of Mortimer&rsquo;s heavy footsteps in his own
quarters; then after awhile, silence. She lay on
her bed in the dark thinking, listening intently.
It was long before she was rewarded.
Then her door opened quietly, and in the
aperture the night-lamp showed a pale, tear-stained
face and a slender, girlish figure
swathed in a pale blue dressing gown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patricia!&rdquo; the girl half sobbed, half
whispered, &ldquo;Patty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia rose in her bed and took the slender
figure into her sheltering arms. &ldquo;Aurora&mdash;darling.
I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you. Can
you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; sobbed the girl. &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were too good for him, Aurora, dear.
He wasn&rsquo;t worthy of you.&rdquo; And then, as an
afterthought. &ldquo;But then, I don&rsquo;t know a man
who is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia breathed a sigh of relief. She had
thought it was going to be more difficult.
She made room for the girl in the bed beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
her and soothed and petted her until she fell
asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Aurora,&rdquo; she murmured softly to
herself. &ldquo;You were never destined for a life
like that, child. The man you marry is to be
an American, a fine, young, healthy animal
like yourself. I will not tell you his name
because if I did, you&rsquo;d probably refuse him,
and of course that would never do. It must
be managed some way. He&rsquo;s poor, you know,
dear, but then that won&rsquo;t matter because you
will have enough for both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It did not take Aurora a great while to recover
from the shock of disillusion and before
long she was out on the golf links again,
with her usual happy following. Aurora had
many virtues as well as accomplishments, and
Patricia was very fond of her. During the
winter in the city, she had given a dinner for
her to which Stephen Ventnor was invited.
Patricia&rsquo;s plan had succeeded admirably, for
Ventnor, after several years of indomitable
faithfulness to the ashes of the mourned Patricia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
had suddenly come to life. He liked
Aurora so much that he didn&rsquo;t even take the
trouble to hide his new emotion from Patricia.
Patricia sighed, for even now renunciation
was difficult to her, but when she moved into
the country for the summer, she held out the
latch-string to him for the week ends so
that he could come out every week and play
golf with Aurora, which showed that
after all marriage had taught Patricia something.</p>

<p>Patricia had decided that Aurora North
was to marry Steve Ventnor, and this resolution
made she left no stone unturned to bring
the happy event to a consummation. The skilful
maker of opportunities she remembered
sometimes trusted to opportunity to make itself.
Propinquity, she knew, was her first lieutenant
and the unobtrusive way in which these
two young people were continually thrown together
must have been a surprise even to themselves.
Ventnor took his two weeks of vacation
in July and spent them at the Crabbs&rsquo;.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Patricia had thought that those two weeks
would have brought the happy business to a
conclusion&mdash;for Aurora was just ready to be
caught on the rebound, and Ventnor was now
very much in love. But when Steve&rsquo;s vacation
was over and he had packed his trunk to go
mournfully back to town, Patricia knew that
something had happened to change her well-laid
plans.</p>

<p>She had never given Jimmy McLemore a
thought. She had seen the three many times
during the summer from her bedroom windows,
Aurora, Steve and McLemore, but the
thought of Aurora having a tenderness for the
golfing automaton had never for a moment
entered her mind. She watched Mr. Ventnor&rsquo;s
departing back with mingled feelings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be out on Saturday as usual, won&rsquo;t
you, Steve?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, thank you, Patty,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be out, if you&rsquo;ll have me. But there isn&rsquo;t
much use, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so meek, Steve!&rdquo; she cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re impossible when you&rsquo;re that way.
What earthly use did you make of all of my
training?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ventnor smiled mournfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t begin soon enough, Patty,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>That pleased Patricia and she made a mental
resolution that marry Aurora, Steve
should, if it lay in her power to accomplish
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong with that girl,&rdquo;
she mused, as she watched Aurora and &ldquo;the
Sphynx&rdquo;&mdash;as McLemore was familiarly
called&mdash;playing the fifth hole. &ldquo;Anybody
who can see anything marriageable in Jimmy
McLemore, ought to be carefully confined behind
a garden wall. Jimmy! I would as soon
think of marrying a statue of Buddha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Blue Wing</i> was out of commission for
the summer. Mortimer insisted that no sane
man could maintain both a big yacht and a big
country place. But Patricia was very happy
and watched the development of Steve Ventnor&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
romance with a jealous eye. She was
obliged to admit, as the summer lengthened
into autumn, that after all, the whole thing
was very much a matter of golf.</p>

<p>Aurora was golf mad, Patricia knew, and
when Jimmy McLemore ran down a twenty-foot
putt for a &ldquo;bird&rdquo; on the sixteenth hole,
thereby winning &ldquo;three up and two&rdquo; from
Steve Ventnor, the golf championship of the
Country Club, Patricia detached herself from
the &ldquo;gallery&rdquo; which had followed the players
and made her way sadly to the Club House
veranda. Penelope Wharton, her sister, who
was fond of Ventnor, followed, the picture of
dejection. In the morning round Steve had
been &ldquo;one up&rdquo;; and the hopes of the two
women had run high that their champion
would be able to increase his lead during the
afternoon, or at least to maintain it against
his redoubtable adversary, but after the first
few holes the victor had developed one of
those &ldquo;streaks&rdquo; for which he was famous, and
though poor old Steve had played a steady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
up-hill game, the luck went against him and
he knew at the tenth hole that unless McLemore
fell over in a fit, the gold cup was lost&mdash;for
that year at least.</p>

<p>Patricia realized, too, that the famous gold
cup might not be the only prize at stake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she said wrathfully, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll
probably marry that <i>person</i>.&rdquo; Mr. McLemore
would have withered could he have seen the
expression in Patricia&rsquo;s eyes, for when Patricia
called any human being a &ldquo;person,&rdquo; it
meant that her thoughts were unutterable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Penelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no patience with Aurora North,&rdquo; said
Patty, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s absolutely lacking in a sense of
proportion. Imagine letting one&rsquo;s life happiness
hang on the fate of a single putt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Steve is <i>such</i> a dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is, that&rsquo;s the worst of it&mdash;and they&rsquo;re
eminently fitted for each other in every way&mdash;by
birth, breeding, and circumstances. As a
sportsman Jimmy may be a success, but as a
gentleman&mdash;as a lover&mdash;as a <i>husband</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Patricia&rsquo;s two brown hands were raised in
protest toward Olympus. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s odious, Pen,
a case for a grand jury&mdash;or a coroner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aurora is too nice a girl,&rdquo; sighed Penelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice! In everything but discrimination.
That&rsquo;s the peril of being an &lsquo;out-of-door girl.&rsquo;
The more muscle, the less gray matter. That
kind of thing disturbs the balance of power.&rdquo;
Patricia sighed&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, I tried it and I know.
A woman with too much muscle is like an
over-rigged yawl&mdash;all right in light airs, but
dangerous in a blow. What&rsquo;s the use? Our
greatest strength after all, is weakness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you couldn&rsquo;t convince Aurora of
that&mdash;nor Steve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Patricia, slowly, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;d like to try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Further talk was interrupted by the arrival
of the crowd from the fair-green, thirsty and
controversial. Steve Ventnor, like the good
loser that he was, had been the first to shake
McLemore by the hand in congratulation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
if he was heavy of heart, his smiling face gave
no sign of it. For the present, at least, he had
abandoned the field to his conqueror who
brought up the rear of the &ldquo;gallery&rdquo; with
Aurora, accepting handshakes right and left
with the changeless dignity which had gained
him his sobriquet of &ldquo;Sphynx.&rdquo; At the veranda
steps Mortimer Crabb took him in tow
and brought him to the table where Penelope
and Patricia were mournfully absorbing lemonade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad, Steve,&rdquo; said Patricia with a
brightness that failed to deceive. &ldquo;Nobody
with mere blood in his veins can expect to
compete with a hydraulic ram. He&rsquo;s a wonderful
piece of mechanism&mdash;Jimmy is&mdash;but
I&rsquo;m always tortured with the fear that he may
forget to wind himself up some morning.
Mort, couldn&rsquo;t you have dropped a little sand
in his bearings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s got plenty of sand,&rdquo; said Crabb
generously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a cracking good golfer,&rdquo; said Steve,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
looking reprovingly at Patricia. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the
better man, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sank beside Patricia while Crabb had
a steward take the orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; muttered Patricia. &ldquo;Not that, not
the better man, only the better golfer, Steve.&rdquo;
And then with a sudden and mystifying
change of manner, &ldquo;Do you know why he always
wears a crimson vest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never thought,&rdquo; replied Steve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very&mdash;un&mdash;er&mdash;unprofessional&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t what a man wears that wins holes,
you know, Patty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she said, carelessly, &ldquo;I was just
wondering&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mortimer Crabb, unofficial host of the occasion,
had beckoned to Aurora and McLemore,
who now joined the party. Steve
Ventnor rose as the girl approached and their
eyes met. Aurora&rsquo;s eyes were the color of
lapis-lazuli, but the deep tan of her skin made
them seem several shades lighter. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
handsome eyes, very clear and expressive, and
at important moments like the present ones
her long lashes effectually screened what
might have been read in their depths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Steve,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;You
didn&rsquo;t have enough practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you really?&rdquo; asked Steve. He bent his
head forward and said something for Aurora&rsquo;s
ears alone, at which her lids dropped
still further and the ends of her lips curved
demurely. But she did not reply, and turned
in evident relief when Crabb made a hospitable
suggestion.</p>

<p>Patricia watched the by-play with interest.
She had followed the romance with mingled
feelings, for it was apparent that the triangle
which had been equilateral in the spring was
now distorted out of all semblance to its
former shape, with poor Steve getting the
worst of it. The reason was clear. The
Sphynx was rich and so could afford to
play golf with Aurora every day of the year
if he wished, while Steve Ventnor, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
spent his daylight hours selling bonds in
the city, had to make the most of his Saturday
and Sunday afternoons. It was really too
bad.</p>

<p>But the Sphynx only smiled his unhumorous
smile, and went on playing golf during
the week when Ventnor was at work. Propinquity
had done a damage which even Patricia,
with all her worldliness, could not find
available means to repair. But she joined
good-humoredly in the toasts to the new club
champion who was accepting his honors carelessly,
keeping her eyes meanwhile on Jimmy
McLemore&rsquo;s crimson vest. That vest was a
part of Jimmy&rsquo;s golf, as much a part of it
as his tauric glasses, his preliminary wiggle
on the tee, or his maddening precision on the
putting-green. It fascinated her somehow,
almost to the exclusion of the gayety in which
she rightfully had a part.</p>

<p>The gold cup was brought forth and passed
from hand to hand. As it came to Patricia
she looked at it inside and out, read the inscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
leisurely, then handed it carelessly
to her neighbor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chaste and quite expensive,&rdquo; was her comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think it&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; said Aurora,
reprovingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Chaque enfant à son gou gou</i>, my dear,&rdquo;
said Patricia. &ldquo;You know, Aurora, I never
did approve of golf prizes&mdash;especially valuable
ones. After all, golf is merely a game&mdash;not
a religion. It&rsquo;s the habit in this club to
consider a golf cup with the same kind of an
eye that one gives to a possible seat in Paradise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even Steve Ventnor thought Patricia&rsquo;s remarks
in bad taste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Jimmy plays the game of life the way
he played golf to-day,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll
have an eighteen-karat halo, and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patty!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss North, reprovingly.
&ldquo;You know you don&rsquo;t believe a word
you say. You love golf prizes. Why you&rsquo;re
always giving the Bachelors&rsquo; Cup, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
year you&rsquo;ve presented the cup for the &lsquo;Affinity
Foursomes.&rsquo; Besides, you&rsquo;ve won at least
three prizes yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve reformed,&rdquo; said Patricia, decisively.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost patience with golf. I haven&rsquo;t any
interest in a game that requires the elimination
of all human attributes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One can&rsquo;t be entirely human and play a
good game of golf, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; she announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rough on McLemore,&rdquo; laughed
Mortimer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s human to be irritated, human to be
angry, human to have nerves, human to make
mistakes. I&rsquo;ve no patience with people who
can&rsquo;t lose their tempers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m apt to lose mine, if you keep calling
me names,&rdquo; said the Sphynx, affably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t, Jimmy,&rdquo; said Patricia, soberly.
&ldquo;Anyone who can make the tenth,
eleventh and twelfth in eleven playing out of
two bunkers will never lose his temper in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
world&mdash;or anything else,&rdquo; she added, <i>sotto
voce</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any more Bachelors&rsquo; Cups,
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if I can help it. At least not for the
Ancient and Honorable Game as we play it
now. The Bachelors&rsquo; Cup this fall will be
played for across country.&rdquo; The members
of the party examined her as though they believed
she had suddenly been bereft of her
senses&mdash;all but her husband, who knew that in
being surprised at Patty, one was wasting
valuable energy, but even Mortimer was
mildly curious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Across country!&rdquo; they asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. I&rsquo;m going to invest the game
with a real sporting interest, develop the possibilities
of the niblick, eliminate the merely
mechanical, introduce a stronger element of
chance. The course will be laid out like a
&lsquo;drag.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With an anise-seed bag?&rdquo; queried Crabb.</p>

<p>Patricia withered her husband with a look.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
&ldquo;With scraps of paper,&rdquo; she asserted, firmly.
&ldquo;The course will be four miles long over good
hunting country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; said McLemore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do. It&rsquo;s quite feasible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good sporting proposition,&rdquo; said
Aurora North, suddenly kindling to interest.
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ventnor and McLemore only smiled amusedly,
as became true golfers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh you can laugh, you two. Why not give
it a trial? Just to make it interesting I&rsquo;ll offer
a cup for the Club champion and runner-up.
It will be a pretty cup&mdash;and Aurora and I will
caddy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; laughed Aurora.</p>

<p>There the matter stopped. It was a joke, of
course, and both men realized it, but any joke
in which Aurora North had a part was the
joke for them. A week passed before Patricia
completed her plans and in the meanwhile
everybody had forgotten all about her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
amazing proposition. It was, therefore, with
surprise and not a little amusement that McLemore
and Ventnor received the dainty notice
in Patricia&rsquo;s handwriting, which advised
them that the Cross Country Match would be
played off on the following Thursday afternoon,
at two o&rsquo;clock. Jimmy McLemore
smiled at a photograph on the desk in his library,
but later in the day after a talk over
the telephone with Aurora he got a mashie,
and a heavy mid-iron from his bag and went
out in his own cow-pasture to practice. Steve
Ventnor in his office in the city turned the
note over in his fingers and frowned. Thursday
was his busiest day, but he realized that
he had given his promise and that if McLemore
played he must. It was a very silly business.
Several things mystified him, however.
What did Patricia mean, for instance, by the
absurd lines at the bottom of his invitation?
&ldquo;Aurora will caddy for you; and don&rsquo;t wear a
crimson vest&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing to be gained by
it.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>On a slip of paper enclosed were the <i>local
rules</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">(1) The first ball and every fourth ball thereafter
may be played from a rubber tee.</p>

<p class="hang">(2) A ball in &ldquo;casual&rdquo; water may be lifted
and dropped without penalty.</p>

<p class="hang">(3) Running brooks, ponds, rocks, fences,
etc., are natural hazards, and must be
played over as such.</p>

<p class="hang">(4) A lost ball means the loss of one stroke,
but not of distance. A ball may be
dropped within twenty-five yards of
the spot where ball disappeared.</p>

<p class="hang">(5) <i>The match must be finished</i> within four
hours. The competitor who for any
reason fails to finish loses the match.</p></div>

<p>Steve Ventnor smiled as he read, but in
spite of his golf sense, which is like no other
sense in the world, felt himself gently warming
to the project. He would go of course&mdash;for
Aurora was to caddy for him.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>


<p class="cap">Even Mortimer Crabb was excluded
from that charming luncheon of
four. It was very informal and
great was the merriment at Patricia&rsquo;s expense,
but through it all she smiled calmly
at their scepticism&mdash;as Columbus at Salamanca
must have smiled, if he ever did, or
Newton or Edison, or any others of the
world&rsquo;s great innovators.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cross-country golf,&rdquo; she continued proudly
to assert, &ldquo;is the golf of the New Era.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really mean it, Patty?&rdquo; asked Aurora
seriously, when the men had gone upstairs
to change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do, Aurora. The Ancient and
Honorable Game has its limitations. Cross-country
golf has none. You&rsquo;ll see, my dear,
in ten years, they&rsquo;ll be playing distance
matches between New York and Philadelphia&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
fewest strokes in the shortest time&mdash;that
<i>will</i> be a game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;ll pay for the lost balls?&rdquo; asked
Aurora, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, Aurora,&rdquo; replied Patricia with a
touch of dignity, &ldquo;is something with which I
am remotely concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men came down stairs dressed for the
fray, grinning broadly, and Patricia, after a
glance at McLemore&rsquo;s red vest, took up his
golf bag with a business-like air and led the
way to the terrace. The Sphynx blinked
through his tauric glasses at her unresponsive
back silhouetted in the doorway, but as Aurora
had taken Steve&rsquo;s bag, he followed
meekly, submitting to the inevitable. Outside,
Patricia was indicating a rift in the
row of maples which bordered her vegetable
garden, through which was to be
seen the brown sweep of the meadow beyond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The drive is through there. You&rsquo;ll get the
direction marks for your second. The distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
is four miles. The finish is on Aurora&rsquo;s
lawn&mdash;the putting-green near the rear portico
of the house. Drive off, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The honor was Mr. McLemore&rsquo;s. With a
saddish smile, half of pity and half of a protest
for his outraged golfing dignity, he took
his bag from Patricia, and with a frugality
which did him credit, upturned the bag on
the lawn, spilling out a miscellany of old balls
which he had saved for practice strokes. Selecting
half a dozen, he stuffed five of them
in his pockets, returned the newer ones to his
bag and scorning the rubber tee which Patricia
offered him, dropped a ball over his
shoulder and took his cleek out of his bag.
Each act was sportsman-like&mdash;a fine expression
of the golfing spirit.</p>

<p>The drive went straight&mdash;and they saw it
bouncing coquettishly up the meadow beyond.
Steve, with the munificence which only poverty
knows, brought forth a new ball, took
the rubber tee and, with his driver, got
off a long low one which cleared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
bushes and vanished over the brow of the
hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A new golfing era has begun,&rdquo; said Patricia,
with the air of a prophet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I ever find my ball,&rdquo; said Ventnor, dubiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you care, Steve, as long as you&rsquo;re
making history?&rdquo; laughed Aurora, with a sly
glance at their hostess.</p>

<p>Patricia, unperturbed, led the way through
a breach in the hedge and out into the sunlight
where she raised a crimson parasol, which no
one had noticed before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My complexion,&rdquo; she explained to Aurora.
&ldquo;One can&rsquo;t be too careful when one gets to be&mdash;ahem&mdash;thirty.
Besides, it just matches
Jimmy&rsquo;s vest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grass in the pasture was short and McLemore
played his brassey&mdash;his caddy instructing
him as to the ground on the other
side, which fell gently down to a brook he
could not reach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got that one away,&rdquo; said McLemore, livening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to his task. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really bad going
at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patricia smiled gratefully, but made no response,
for Steve, a little further on, was in a
hole and had to play out with a mashie, which
he did with consummate skill, the ball rolling
down the hill thirty yards short of McLemore&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>From the hilltop they could easily see the
line of the paper chase which Patricia had
laid when she rode over the course yesterday.
It stretched across the lower end
of the Renwick&rsquo;s meadows along the road,
crossing two streams, bordered with willow
trees and led straight for Waterman&rsquo;s stone
quarry. Ventnor played a careful mid-iron
which cleared the brook and bounded forward
into the meadow beyond; but McLemore
overreached himself trying for distance and
found the brook, losing his ball and two
strokes; but he teed up, having played five
and lay six well down the meadow, within
carrying distance of the second stream. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Steve, playing steadily, passed him with his
fourth, a long cleek shot which fell just short
of the stream.</p>

<p>Beyond the creek was the hill to the quarry,
three shots for McLemore, two long ones for
Ventnor. With excellent judgment McLemore
played safely over the creek with a mid-iron,
reaching the brink of the quarry in two
more, which gave him a chance to tee up on
his ninth for the long drive across. Steve
Ventnor was less fortunate, dribbling his sixth
up the hill, fifty yards short of the quarry,
into which, trying a long cleek shot to clear
it, he unfortunately drove. He waited to see
the Sphynx carefully tee his ball and send it
straight down the course which Patricia indicated,
and then taking the bag from his
caddy helped her into the path which zig-zagged
down to where his ball lay, a hundred
feet below.</p>

<p>Patricia and the Sphynx had chosen the
shorter way through the woods at the upper
end and Steve and Aurora were alone.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>At the bottom of the slope behind a projecting
crag Steve stopped and faced his
companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aurora,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Steve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it true you&rsquo;re going to marry McLemore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aurora picked a flower which grew in a
ledge beside her before she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d like to know, that&rsquo;s all. People
say you are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> haven&rsquo;t said so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; eagerly, &ldquo;you aren&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what right you&rsquo;ve got to ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;only I thought I&rsquo;d like to be
the first to congratulate him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I thought I&rsquo;d like to tell you again
that I love you better than anybody could&mdash;and
that I always will, even if you marry him.
He&rsquo;s a very nice fellow but&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll be very
unhappy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you? I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re too cool about it. You
wouldn&rsquo;t think he was such a nice fellow if
you were jealous of him. Why haven&rsquo;t you
played more with me this summer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to work&mdash;you know that. What&rsquo;s
the use&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you love me as you say you do, I don&rsquo;t
see how you could be so cool about&mdash;about
seeing us together&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I wasn&rsquo;t as cool as I looked. See
here, Aurora, you mustn&rsquo;t talk like that.&rdquo; He
had turned and before she could escape him,
had taken her in his arms and was kissing her.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m cool. I love you, Aurora, with
every ounce that&rsquo;s in me. I want you more
than I can ever want anything again in this
world or the next. I&rsquo;m not going to let you
marry that fellow or anybody else&mdash;do you
understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had yielded for a moment to his
warmth because there didn&rsquo;t seem to be anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
else to do. But when she slowly disengaged
herself from his arms and faced him
her eyes were wet and the color flamed
through her tan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steve!&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;Steve!&mdash;how
could you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he still faced her passionately, undaunted.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;I
love you&mdash;you can&rsquo;t marry him&mdash;I won&rsquo;t let
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a step forward but this time she
retreated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Steve&mdash;not again&mdash;not now&mdash;you
mustn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;ll be coming out in the open
there in a moment. I&rsquo;ll never say you are
cool again&mdash;never&mdash;after that. You&rsquo;re not
cool&mdash;not in the least&mdash;I was mistaken. I&rsquo;ve
never seen you&mdash;like this before&mdash;you&rsquo;re different&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You made me do it. I couldn&rsquo;t stand
your saying I didn&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m not sorry,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;he couldn&rsquo;t love you the way I
do.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think perhaps you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Aurora
coolly. &ldquo;In the meantime&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you give me an answer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile,&rdquo; she went on, preening
her disordered hair, &ldquo;<a href="#image04">you are supposed to be
playing the golf of the New Era</a>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;">

<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;<a href="#Page_256">You are supposed to be playing the golf of the New Era.</a>&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Aurora&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she had taken up his golf bag and
was walking away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you answer me?&rdquo; he pleaded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get your ball out of this quarry,&rdquo; she said,
relentlessly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll think about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took Steve Ventnor thirteen strokes to
play out of that quarry, which, for a fellow
with a record of seventy-two at Apawomeck,
was &ldquo;going it.&rdquo; The first stroke he missed
clean; the second he sliced into a clay-bank;
his third struck the rocks and bounded back
against the wall behind him, finding lodgment
at last in some bushes where he took three
more. To make matters worse, Aurora was
laughing at him, hysterically, unrestrainedly,
and Patricia and the Sphynx, who had appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
on the path above, were joining in the
merriment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll lift,&rdquo; he growled at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; laughed Aurora. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s against
the rules.&rdquo; And Patricia appealed to, confirmed
the statement.</p>

<p>Three more swings he took, each of them
in impossible lies, the last of which smashed
his niblick. After that there followed a period
of strange calmness&mdash;of desperation, while he
worked his ball into a good lie on the far side
of the quarry from which, with a fine mashie
shot he lifted it over the cliffs and into the
open beyond.</p>

<p>Steve Ventnor toiled wearily up the hill
at the heels of his caddy, struggling for his
lost composure. He caught up with Aurora
at a point half-way up where he took the golf
bag from her shoulder and faced her again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you answer me, Aurora?&rdquo; he
pleaded, breathlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, calmly. &ldquo;You
swore&mdash;horribly&mdash;in the bushes.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard you,&rdquo; firmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never marry
a man who swears,&rdquo; and she hurried on.
When Ventnor joined the others, he found
Patricia sitting on a rock making up the score,
which at the present moment stood: Ventnor&mdash;20;
McLemore&mdash;9.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you like it, Steve?&rdquo; asked Patricia,
still figuring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; said Steve, ironically,
holding up his shattered niblick. &ldquo;I like
granite, it&rsquo;s so spongy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve got a bad temper,
Steve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ventnor had taken out his pipe, lit it
and was now doggedly moving toward his
ball.</p>

<p>The luck favored him on his next volley,
for playing two mid-irons down the hill, he
reached the level meadow below safely, while
McLemore sliced his second into a row of hot
frames, where an indignant horticulturist and
two dogs contributed an interesting mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
hazard. But the Sphynx handed the farmer
a dollar in exchange for lacerated feelings and
glass, and the match went on. Over the brook
McLemore lay thirteen, having &ldquo;dubbed&rdquo;
his shot into the stream, but playing steadily
after that reached the top of the long hill before
them, safely in four more; while Ventnor
lost his ball in the bushes and was now playing
twenty-five.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>


<p class="cap">From there on, the luck varied and at
the Stockbridge farm the score stood
McLemore, 21; Ventnor, 30. It seemed
a difficult lead to overcome, for the Sphynx
was playing straight with a mid-iron, while
Steve, whose only hope lay in getting distance,
had twice pulled into rough grass, which cost
him lost balls and extra strokes. The wonder
was how he played at all, for Aurora had refused
to marry him three times in the last
twenty minutes. The result was inevitable,
and so like the man in the adage, after playing
thirty-eight strokes, he &ldquo;went up in the
air,&rdquo; missing shot after shot and relinquishing
all claim to consideration, playing on only
because fate seemed to demand it of him.</p>

<p>At the Van Westervelt&rsquo;s fence both men
got off &ldquo;good ones,&rdquo; landing well in the middle
of the pasture and had gone forward into
the field, their caddies close behind them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
when from the shelter of a clump of trees
along the stream to their left, there emerged a
shadow. Aurora saw it first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bull,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s only a cow,&rdquo; ventured the Sphynx,
whose tauric glasses were not adjusted to distances&mdash;or
to bulls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a bull,&rdquo; repeated Aurora.</p>

<p>Steve glanced at the beast over his shoulder,
and then took a brassey from his bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t bother us,&rdquo; he muttered. But
the animal was approaching majestically,
pausing now and then to paw up the dirt with
his front hoofs and throwing a cloud of dust
over his back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your parasol, Patty,&rdquo; said Aurora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or Jimmy&rsquo;s vest,&rdquo; put in Patricia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better run for it, you and Aurora,&rdquo;
said Ventnor. &ldquo;You can easily make the
fence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to play this shot. It&rsquo;s the prettiest
lie I&rsquo;ve had all day.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Aurora,&rdquo; said Patricia, taking up
her bag. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to lose. He&rsquo;s
really coming this way,&rdquo; and gathering up her
golf bag and skirts, she ran. The Sphynx,
meanwhile, still holding his mid-iron in his
hand, was undecided. His ball was twenty
yards further on, and his eyes shifted uneasily
from the bull to an old apple-tree within a
reaching distance. The women by this time
had reached a convenient stile and were
perched upon it shouting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, Steve!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ventnor, who was addressing his ball,
glanced up for a moment and then swung. It
was the prettiest shot that he had made all
day, for the ball started with a low trajectory
and soared and soared, clearing the fence
on the far side of the field, a carry of two
hundred yards, and landed in the next
meadow. Then he turned, club in hand, and
looked at the bull which now stood twenty
paces away, eying them viciously. It was too
late to make a sprint for the fence, and like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
McLemore, Steve wistfully eyed the apple-tree.
But he brandished his brassey manfully
and prepared to jump aside if the bull lowered
his head and rushed him. It was at this
moment that Jimmy McLemore, white as a
sheet, made up his mind to run. Jimmy&rsquo;s red
vest decided the matter, and scorning Ventnor,
with a bellow which lent wings to Jimmy&rsquo;s
feet, the brute lowered its thick head and
charged, passing like a tornado under the limb
to which McLemore had fled for safety.
Steve Ventnor forgot to be frightened and
stood leaning on his club roaring with laughter,
for the Sphynx&rsquo;s dignity had always been
a fearful and wonderful thing to him. He
heard the voices of the women behind him,
pleading with him to run, but in his heart
Steve Ventnor made a mighty resolution that
run he would not. He had no dignity like
Jimmy&rsquo;s to lose, but the spectacle Jimmy made
decided him. It took some strength of mind
to moderate his pace as he picked up Patricia&rsquo;s
red parasol and walked toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
fence. The bull however, refused to be distracted,
and stood pawing the ground beneath
the apple-tree, bellowing up at the soles of the
Sphynx&rsquo;s boots and making havoc of the beautiful
Campbell mid-iron, which was the only
thing of Jimmy&rsquo;s that he could touch.</p>

<p>The women on the stile were laughing, Patricia
frankly, uncontrollably, Aurora nervously,
looking at Steve as he came up with a
queer little anxious wrinkle between her eyebrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any patience with you,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You might have been gored to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ventnor was still laughing. &ldquo;I never saw
Jimmy run before,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to
get him out of that somehow. I think I&rsquo;ll
have a try at it with Patricia&rsquo;s parasol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Patricia quickly snatched it from his
hand. Her little drama had worked out far
more beautifully than she had ever hoped it
would, and she didn&rsquo;t propose to have it
ruined now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
do whatever you like with your own skin, but
that is a perfectly good French parasol, and
it&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo; And she put it behind her back.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Sphynx was pelting the
brute below him with apples and shouting
anathema, both of which rolled from the animal&rsquo;s
impervious back, as he circled angrily
around the tree, up which he showed every
disposition to climb. From tragic-comedy the
scene had degenerated into broadest farce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like Sothern playing a part of Georgie
Cohan&rsquo;s,&rdquo; commented Patricia, sweetly. &ldquo;Is
he apt to be there all day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks so,&rdquo; said Aurora, struggling between
anxiety and laughter. &ldquo;We really
ought to do something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Patricia had settled herself comfortably
on the top rail of the fence. Things were
going very much to her liking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell somebody. There&rsquo;s a wagon coming
this way now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how about the Cross-Country Cup?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
looking at her watch. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only an hour
and a half to finish in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t leave him up there,&rdquo; said
Steve, more seriously. &ldquo;That bull will be
there until&mdash;until the cows come home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy is perfectly safe,&rdquo; said Patricia,
&ldquo;unless he goes to sleep and falls out; and he
can&rsquo;t starve unless he throws all the apples
at the bull.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patty, you&rsquo;re heartless,&rdquo; said Aurora, but
she laughed when she said it.</p>

<p>The farmer who came along in the wagon
took in the situation at a glance and laughing
more loudly than any of them, consented at
last to drive to the barnyard and tell the
farmer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any good,&rdquo; he said, sagely.
&ldquo;That bull won&rsquo;t go back until he follows the
cows at milking time. He might quit before
that&mdash;I dunno. I&rsquo;ll do what I can though.&rdquo;
And with a laconic chirrup to his nag, he departed
in the direction of the Van Westervelts&rsquo;
farmyard.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>The party of three followed him with their
eyes until he had disappeared in a cloud of
dust and then examined the apple-tree from
which the Sphynx&rsquo;s legs dangled hopelessly.
The rest of him was hidden among the leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until the cows come home,&rdquo; said Patricia,
solemnly, and looking into one another&rsquo;s eyes
all three of them burst into shameless laughter.
And with that laugh free-masonry was
established. It was plainly to be read in Aurora&rsquo;s
eyes. The toppling of Jimmy&rsquo;s dignity
had been too much for her own sense of
gravity.</p>

<p>Patricia meanwhile had taken out her
watch. &ldquo;This, my dear children,&rdquo; she said,
indicating with a fine gesture, the Sphynx&rsquo;s
apple-tree, &ldquo;is one of the hazards of the New
Game of Golf. There is only an hour and a
half to finish in. Play the game, you two, I
must wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be the sporting thing,&rdquo; said
Steve, struggling with a desire to obey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know who is as good a judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
of the rules of a game as its inventor,&rdquo; said
Patricia. &ldquo;Am I right, Aurora?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aurora by this time was fingering at the
strap of Ventnor&rsquo;s golf bag. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she decided,
&ldquo;as Patricia says, it&rsquo;s in the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Steve glanced at her quickly, joyfully, but
her head was lowered and she was already
down the steps of the stile and walking along
the road toward the adjoining meadow. Ventnor&rsquo;s
eyes met Patricia&rsquo;s for the fraction of a
second of wireless telegraphy, after which
Steve plunged down the steps and followed
his caddy.</p>

<p>The gabled roof of Augustus North&rsquo;s house
was visible above the trees scarcely half a
mile away, but the paper chase led to it by
devious, sequestered ways, which Steve Ventnor
and his caddy scrupulously followed.
Many times on the way they stopped in the
shadow of the trees, and but a few minutes of
time remained when Steve ran down his putt.
It had taken him just one hundred and three
shots to do that last nine hundred yards in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
hour and forty minutes. His caddy counted
them; which only went to prove her a conscientious
person, for under the circumstances
book-keeping was a difficult matter.</p>

<p>Perched upon her stile, in smiling patience
Patricia waited &ldquo;until the cows came home,&rdquo;
while Mortimer Crabb, who had been notified
over the telephone of the disaster, drove
up to see the final chapter in Jimmy McLemore&rsquo;s
undoing. For the farmer came and at
some pains extracted him from his perilous
post. The Crabbs drove McLemore to his
home in their motor and then ran over to the
Norths to hear how the cross-country match
had finished. The happy couple met them at
the steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ball is in the hole, Patty, dear,&rdquo; said
Steve Ventnor. &ldquo;Do I win the Cup?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do,&rdquo; said Patricia, looking at her
watch, &ldquo;by three hours and a half. And it&rsquo;s
a loving-cup, Steve, with cupids and things,
I had it made especially for you and Aurora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aurora kissed Patricia with enthusiasm.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know, Patty, it was to be
Steve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simplest thing imaginable! Because Steve
is the most adorable boy, always excepting
Mort, that was ever born&mdash;and then you
know, Aurora&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t have married
Jimmy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Aurora, thinking of Jimmy&rsquo;s
legs in the apple-tree, &ldquo;I really couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Steve refused to return to the Crabbs&rsquo; to
dinner, so the Makers of Opportunities departed
alone. Mortimer drove slowly through
the gathering dusk and Patricia sat silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you happy, Patty?&rdquo; he asked, at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; said Patricia, pinching
his ear, &ldquo;you know I&rsquo;m never happy with you,
Mort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you getting a little tired of putting
the world in order?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. But young people are <i>so</i> provoking.
They can never make up their own
minds, and you know <i>somebody</i> has to do it
for them.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you ever wondered how the world
would get on without you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but sometimes I&rsquo;ve wondered how
you would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? Ah! I wouldn&rsquo;t get on at all. And
yet you know there&rsquo;s a responsibility in being
married to a Dea ex Machina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The machinery may run down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The goddess may end in the ditch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mort!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or get a blow-out&mdash;you came near it,
Patty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, Mort&mdash;ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was going to say John Doe, but she put
her fingers over his lips so that he only mumbled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mort&mdash;I&rsquo;m a prudent goddess&mdash;a
chauffeuse extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of that, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No car can endure so long out of the
garage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a silly old thing.&rdquo; She sighed
comfortably and leaned her head over on his
shoulder. In a moment she spoke again. &ldquo;I
think you&rsquo;re quite right though, Mort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you tired of making opportunities
for other people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made a sound that he understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, a little, you know, Patty,&rdquo; he added.
The motor purred gently as it glided out of
a country road into the turnpike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say if we begin making opportunities
for each other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started up with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When
shall we start?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At once, Patty. If you&rsquo;ll provide the opportunity,&rdquo;
and he kissed her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be its
thief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she captured him at once.</p>

<p>In this new novel the author treats his readers to a splendid
story of society and studio life in New York city. It is a
novel that holds attention from the first, having all the interest
and fascination of a Chambers society story, with the added
charm of the gay artists&rsquo; life in a great city with its frank
camaraderie, witty small talk and undisguised disregard of
convention.</p>

<p>It is a great love story, concerning itself with Valerie West,
a gently bred girl, who from a cloistered life with an invalid
mother comes to the studio of Louis Neville, an artist
of aristocratic and snobbish ancestry. She seeks employment
as a model, and her beauty readily wins an audience, while
her physical perfections suit the work that Neville has in hand,
so that she is eagerly engaged.</p>

<p>The story follows this association through a rapid progress
from intellectual companionship, pure friendship and then
fervid love. Love triumphant over tradition is the concluding
note of the story.</p>

<p>A young English widow of wealth and position traveling
in Egypt meets a Russian prince of great personal charm and
high rank, whose masterful attentions at once pique the lady&rsquo;s
warm interest. They are companions on her return voyage
to England, during which her emotions are further stirred
by the varied characteristics of the young prince, and almost
immediately she leaves for St. Petersburg to visit her godmother,
a woman of rank and fashion, whom she had hitherto
never met. In St. Petersburg she again meets the young
prince, who is a great favorite. Love between them develops,
but the man&rsquo;s assurance and frank expectations render the
lady haughty and reserved. There are occasions, however,
when she yields to his ardor in so far as to show that she
loves him. From this point the author then spins a vivid
and exotic love story, and one that will appeal to all classes
of fiction readers.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
